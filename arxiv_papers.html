                        We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the
open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity,
\textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main
sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a
positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO
stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS
while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening
effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close
binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the
tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking
hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial
distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the
cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that
tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation
rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during
the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the
rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.

                        Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the
discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an
extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12,
based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000
au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped
stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO
(5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$
km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical
timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of
SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased
temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked
point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$.
Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region,
characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta
(5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70
$\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly
discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely
young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest
that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously
understood.

                        Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from
high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can
effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims
to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately
one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity.
The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence
and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population
Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open
clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and
reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and
homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the
equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral
synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti),
light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the
existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe]
versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns
predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are
present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a
negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and
reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical
evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for
upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and
WEAVE.

                        Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down
to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures,
called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are
connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the
connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales
towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I
protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM
30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in
the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are
associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN,
while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the
former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope
scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses
and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6
Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope
mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low
compared to the envelope mass (<1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of
the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of
mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The
rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the
large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three
disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this
surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However,
we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could
be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.

                        We analyze the stellar light, 4000 Angstrom break and emission line profiles
of 82 edge-on disk galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We characterize the stellar
light profiles perpendicular to the disk plane using two parameters: a) the
power law slope of the thick disk component, 2) the transition radius where the
profile flattens. The 4000 Angstrom break profiles perpendicular to the plane
are characterized by the number of significant changes in slope (breaks) and by
the change in D_n(4000) from inner to outer disk. The slope correlates tightly
with the stellar mass of the galaxy over the stellar mass range 10^9<log
M*<10^10 M_sun. More massive galaxies have more extended thick disks. The slope
and transition radius exhibit large scatter for galaxies more massive than
10^{10} M_sun. Half the sample have older stellar populations in their thick
disks, a third have flat D$_n$(4000) profiles and 15% have younger thick disks.
The D$_n$(4000) profiles exhibit as many as 4 separate breaks. There are more
breaks in massive galaxies with bulges and more extended thick disks. This may
indicate that the breaks are produced by more frequent accretion events in such
systems. The extra-planar Halpha EQW correlates most strongly with the specific
star formation rate of the galaxy, and the [OII]/Halpha ratio increases with
distance from the disk plane. This increase is most apparent for massive
galaxies with extended thick disk components and low SFR/M* These findings
support the hypothesis that the larger [OII]/Halpha ratios may be caused by
ionization from evolved stars.

                        Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and
majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of
dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context,
we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} >
10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961
non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$
M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a
previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with
merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates
(SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the
median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and
redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and
suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement.
The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in
post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found
to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer
regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts.
This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the
merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given
small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific
SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers
are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime,
where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests
that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more
comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their
evolution.

                        Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our
understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight
into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the
largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of
seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local
$5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures
show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known
star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,
primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are
precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show
an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the
Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary
by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only.
This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal
structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These
findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic
structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and
likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.

                        In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux
concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA
data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm
H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm
H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$
flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find
that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted
stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental
effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation
main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we
find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have
higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass
regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently
occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of
prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy
structure formation are discussed.

                        The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex
and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across
its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical
evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from
an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and
most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation
(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex
in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major
merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in
the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have
experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our
previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of
wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned
merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the
clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge
formations.
  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample
that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the
expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show
a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models
that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with
the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we
suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,
which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic
chemical enrichment over time.

                        Star-forming galaxies on the main sequence (MS) are often regarded as a
uniform population characterized by similar global star formation properties.
However, there exists a diversity in galaxy morphologies at fixed stellar mass
and SFR. In this study, using spatially-resolved properties from the MaNGA
final data release, we classify MS galaxies into late-type (MS-late) and
early-type (MS-early). In addition, we further divide the MS-early galaxies
into two distinct subgroups based on their internal star formation and stellar
mass distributions within the galaxies. The first group -- ``MS-early\_SF'' --
shows centrally concentrated star formation without prominent stellar bulges
and resides preferentially in dense environments, suggesting
environmentally-driven evolution. The second group -- ``MS-early\_stellar'' --
exhibits significant stellar bulges with suppressed central star formation,
maintains disk-like star formation patterns, and inhabits environments similar
to those of late-type galaxies, indicating evolution through internal secular
processes. Our findings demonstrate that spatially-resolved observations play
critical roles in revealing the diverse evolutionary pathways hidden within
galaxies that share similar global properties.
