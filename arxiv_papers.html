                        Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape
molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both
driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific
signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such
signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds
formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the
shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC
G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at
the Instituto de Radioastronom\`ia Millim\'etrica. We find that the dense gas
is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different
velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments
are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a
position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature,
typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow
SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with
the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also
report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely
driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell.
The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our
preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We
conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding
clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate
that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled
the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation
may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.

                        Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric
and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual
gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a
comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters.
Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs
involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types:
primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and
hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to
quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed
multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster
pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243
pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions.
This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular
cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces.
In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster
systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature
confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery
of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are
involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star
clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a
comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high
fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that
cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work
offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution
of multiple star cluster systems.

                        The gravitational binding and star-forming properties of molecular clouds
(MCs) in the Milky Way (MW) are estimated from CO cloud observations and from a
model of pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE). Two CO surveys are analyzed
with the standard CO conversion factor. The main results are: (1) For each
survey the cloud virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}$ increases by a factor ~2 from
galactocentric radius $R_{gal}$ = 4 kpc to 15 kpc. (2) PVE models match these
trends only if the surface densities of survey clouds and nearby stars are
comparable. This evidence of environmental influence resembles that seen in
other disk galaxies. (3) Many survey clouds form stars even though their virial
parameter exceeds the critical value $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$. In PVE such clouds
with constant velocity dispersion have stable equilibrium and cannot form stars
by simple global collapse. (4) However, simulations show that
$\alpha_{vir}\approx2$ clouds with dissipating turbulence may form filaments,
cores and protostars with little global contraction. Such clouds can match the
MW star formation rate if their protostellar cores have mass fraction
~10$^{-3}$. A simple model predicts that the star-forming age of a cloud is
proportional to the ratio of its YSOs to its mass. (5) Clouds within ~500 pc of
the Sun are predicted to have star-forming ages 1-10 Myr and average YSO age ~2
Myr, matching evolutionary models. The Orion A cloud is predicted to have ~60
Class 0 protostars, ~2900 YSOs and efficiency $SFE\approx0.02$, in good
agreement with observed estimates.

                        We argue that star formation in the disks of low-surface-brightness (LSB)
galaxies shares a similar nature with that occurring in the far outer regions
of normal-brightness spiral galaxies, such as those with the extended
ultraviolet (XUV) disks. In both cases, stars are born in gravitationally
stable disks with an extremely low average gas density (on kiloparsec scales),
and the efficiency of this process depends on a disk brightness in a similar
way. Processes which can stimulate star formation under these conditions are
shortly discussed.

                        We identify a sample of 324 red and 273 blue face-on spiral galaxies selected
from 115 low-redshift (0.014 < z < 0.18) galaxy clusters imaged with
CFHT+MegaCam in u- and r-band, KPNO 0.9-meter 2TkA and MOSAIC 8K camera in B
and Rc, and images and catalogs extracted from the WINGS survey.
Multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy were obtained by cross-matching
sources with SDSS, GALEX, and WISE datasets. Our main results suggest that up
to 45% of optically red spirals are dusty compared to blue spiral galaxies
based on infrared observations. The presence of dust can obscure star formation
and hence lead to red spirals being misclassified as passive systems.
Approximately half of the red spirals do not show evidence of a large abundance
of dust, hence are optically red due to passive evolution. Support for the
passive nature of these red spirals is provided by SDSS emission line data
based on the Dn(4000) spectral index, EW(H-alpha), EW(H-delta), and [O III]
5007 A luminosity, and on a comparison of the star formation rate and the
specific star formation rate with cluster blue spirals. Red spirals are an
important link in the evolution of galaxies in the high-density cluster
environment and play a key role in determining the physical mechanisms that are
responsible for transforming blue star-forming galaxies into red spiral
systems.

                        OB associations, as an intermediate stage between Galactic clusters and field
stars, play an important role in understanding the star formation process,
early stellar evolution, and Galactic evolution. In this work, we construct a
large sample of OB stars with 6D phase space parameters ($l, b, d, V_{\rm los},
pmra ,pmdec$) by combining the distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021),
radial velocities derived from low-resolution spectra of the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and proper motions from
the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3). This sample includes 19,933 OB stars,
most of which are located within 6\,kpc of the Sun. Using 6D phase space
parameters and friends-of-friends clustering algorithm, we identify 67 OB
associations and 112 OB association candidates, among them, 49 OB associations
and 107 OB association candidates are newly identified. The Galactic rotation
curve derived using 67 OB association members is relatively flat in the range
of Galactocentric distances 7$<$$R$$<$13\,kpc. The angular rotation velocity at
solar Galactocentric distance of $R_\odot$ =8.34\,kpc is $\Omega_0$ =
29.05$\pm$0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of the 67 OB
associations indicates that they are mainly located at low Galactic latitudes
and near spiral arms of the Milky Way. Additionally, we estimate the velocity
dispersions and sizes of these 67 OB associations. Our results show that the
velocity dispersions decrease as Galactocentric distances increase, while their
sizes increase as Galactocentric distances increase.

                        We investigated colour gradients of photometrically selected post-starburst
galaxies (PSBs) at $0.7 < z < 0.9$ in the COSMOS field as a function of central
concentration of asymmetric features, $C_{A}$, in order to understand their
origins. We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies
(QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS
$I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data. We found
that the colour gradient, $\Delta (I-H) = (I-H)_{in} - (I-H)_{out}$, decreases
with increasing $C_{A}$ for all the three populations. Only PSBs with
$\log{C_{A}} > 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central
asymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young
stars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with
half-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The
positive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$
suggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in
the recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\log C_A <
0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger
sizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.
