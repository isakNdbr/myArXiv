                        The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star
formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster
members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant
uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young
Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 <
l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation
in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on
2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm
to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte
Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO
astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the
Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust
membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in
higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In
this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters
with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new
members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars
in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership
probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more
accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within
uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data,
and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

                        We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study
the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence
of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of
members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1
kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM
method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and
extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These
clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc,
covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters,
stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a
signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and
A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi
Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the
existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of
dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is
found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.

                        Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to
become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial
element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear
rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts,
remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the
Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy
morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the
nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed
rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust
lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple
armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope
images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings
are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+
rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand
design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with
later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In
addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear
spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the
nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host
galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a
fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the
nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg
structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very
weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate
cases.

                        Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between
fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation,
self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these
processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10
Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at
100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI
emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes
using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on
studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of
these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for
the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer.
We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by
Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong
criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and
derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$
and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94
Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to
study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and
kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how
stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic
gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then
unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

                        It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at
high-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their
formation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a
sample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the
OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission.
These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with
star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps
with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit
low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70
km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses
inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also
artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a
direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate
that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations,
high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores
the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier
epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in
star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc
as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or
gravitational lensing.

                        We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide
range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen
abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to
density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,
compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those
of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV
nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic
time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns
with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that
galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant
redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between
electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure
contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with
high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong
correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity
outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to
elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results
highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young
stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for
interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.

                        We investigate the impact of an environment-dependent galaxy-wide stellar
initial mass function (gwIMF) on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). The
integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory, which incorporates variations in
stellar populations due to star formation history (SFH) and metallicity,
provides a more accurate framework for understanding systematic deviations in
galaxy scaling relations than that given by an invariant gwIMF. By considering
how the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population is influenced by
metallicity and SFH, we show that high-mass galaxies have their masses in stars
and remnants underestimated under the assumption of a constant mass-to-light
ratio. In contrast, low-mass, gas-dominated galaxies are less affected. Our
results suggest that the discrepancies between the true and observed BTFR are
primarily driven by the evolving nature of the stellar IMF, particularly in
galaxies with slowly declining SFHs. The IGIMF theory offers a solution to the
observed offsets in the BTFR, especially for high-mass galaxies, where the
rotational velocities are higher than predicted by MOND. We conclude that
incorporating the IGIMF provides a more accurate description of galaxy
dynamics, revealing the importance of stellar population characteristics in
refining our understanding of the baryonic mass-velocity relationship. This
study underscores the necessity of accounting for the variation of the gwIMF
when interpreting the BTFR, particularly in the context of alternative
gravitational theories like MOND.

                        Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular
clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host
Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark
matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in
the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects
the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological
simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at
a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M
\lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M
\gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely
arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while
the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing
accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence
suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the
presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation
and the resulting star formation.

                        JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10, with a derived UVLF
that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at
characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its
evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum
densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at
6<z<12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce
the SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when
applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed
stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies'
physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming
different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each
6<z<12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are
classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding
physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log
Mstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to
0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only <20% of
low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in
low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator
of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of
galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to
0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from
observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and
0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither
alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z>10. Our results
add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely
responsible for the high-z UVLF.

                        We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble
[HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is
located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images
(250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the
velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,
distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a
centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an
enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR
images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an
arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust
condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of
12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the
periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm
the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)
located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps
uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the
center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like
morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the
velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar
feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of
the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect
and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the
ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.
