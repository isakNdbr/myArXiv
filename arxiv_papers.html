                        Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,
without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster
census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We
create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic
cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster
census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different
spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters
as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's
selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into
Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We
find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,
extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older
clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper
motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection
effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a
Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite
positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher
scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot
be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the
Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at
least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We
predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be
discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be
explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster
destruction rate in the anticentre.

                        Context. Open clusters are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas
and cosmic dust. They play an important role in studying stars' formation and
evolution and understanding galaxies' structure and dynamics. Aims. The main
objective of this work is to identify stars that belong to open clusters using
astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17.
Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of
the open clusters in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering
algorithm to this data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar
dynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the open clusters were
also calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We found 1987 stars
belonging to 49 open clusters, and 941 of these stars have probabilities above
80 % of belonging to open clusters. Our metallicity gradient presents a
two-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances, the
projected Galactocentric distance, and the guiding center radius to the
Galactic Center, as already reported in previous work. However, when we
separate the open clusters by age, we observe no significant difference in the
metallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center.
Our results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than
those older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the Disk-like
population very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for
disk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange
points L4 and L5.

                        Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding
galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies
the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus
molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its
star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel
images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method,
identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass
segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived
properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles,
constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass
distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation
efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core
formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.

                        The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several
million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical
and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their
associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$
observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming
galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central
region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy
presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and
then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between
the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm
gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of
${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm
log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these
sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is
associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of
star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and
stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the
$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial
scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics
of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The
diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas,
stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although
these relations show relatively large scatter.

                        This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the
local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations.
We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the
local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization
simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict
collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first
all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$,
[NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions
only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry
out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent
metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing
features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very
local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370
$\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the
observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a
factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate
required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas,
possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding
the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their
ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely
ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the
leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of
ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

                        The new generation of optical spectrographs (i.e., WEAVE, 4MOST, DESI, and
WST) offer unprecedented opportunities for statistically studying the star
formation histories of galaxies. However, these observations are not easily
comparable to predictions from cosmological simulations. Our goal is to build a
reference framework for comparing spectroscopic observations with simulations
and test tools for deriving stellar population properties of galaxies. We focus
on the observational strategy of the Stellar Population at Intermediate
Redshift Survey (StePS) with the WEAVE instrument. We generate mock datasets of
~750 galaxies at redshifts z = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 using the TNG50 simulation,
perform radiative transfer with SKIRT, and analyze the spectra with pPXF as if
they were real observations. We present the methodology to generate these
datasets and provide an initial exploration of stellar population parameters
(i.e., mass-weighted ages and metallicities) and star formation histories for
three galaxies at z = 0.7 and their descendants at z = 0.5 and 0.3. We find
good agreement between the mock spectra and intrinsic ages in TNG50 (average
difference $0.2\pm0.3$ Gyr) and successfully recover their star formation
histories, especially for galaxies form the bulk of their stars on short
timescales and at early epochs. We release these datasets, including
multi-wavelength imaging and spectra, to support forthcoming WEAVE
observations.

                        The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for
several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal
complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in
the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two
such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and
topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of
superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of
filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of
spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components.
The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line
profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution
and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare
molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm
line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used
to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity
diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The
unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to
superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1
km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures
with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths
of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is
embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients
found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows.
Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that
mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.

                        Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and
environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation
history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the
possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods.
We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular
gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784.
The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed
using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a
regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular
gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be
explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to
CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion
following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas
collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc,
shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in
GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion
may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a
high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have
undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity.
The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed
encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in
progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent
evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers
beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of
GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.

                        Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio
galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of
the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on
the other. These unique sources provide valuable insights into the physical
mechanisms behind the FR dichotomy. In this study, we report the discovery of
thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the
southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line
survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities, with
a median value of 4.4 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located
within the redshift range 0.04 < z < 1.34. To gain further insights into their
origin, we also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of
their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated
near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that
extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are
high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), hosted by actively star-forming
galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that hybrid morphology may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a
dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one
jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection
of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still
necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.
