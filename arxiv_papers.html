                        The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been
discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of
giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary
interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are
hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$
disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the
Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can
serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs
thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf
candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper,
we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using
Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm
3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star
from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around
[Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5
dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$,
Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common
formation pathway.

                        Open clusters have long been used to determine ages of stars, as well as
calibrate stellar evolution models and other methods of age-dating stellar
groups, e.g., gyrochronology, asteroseismology, and chemical clocks. In this
work, we have obtained new high-resolution (R $\ge$ 50,000), high-S/N, optical
data for 3+ stellar members in open clusters, using Keck/HIRES, with membership
derived from the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey.
From these new Keck/HIRES data, we have derived neutron capture abundances for
stars in seven distant outer Galaxy open cluster

                        Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a
more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took
spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young
clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec.
These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption,
features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS
evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3
variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis
of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos
of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution.
Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for
Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate
kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to
isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We
find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their
isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr
before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for
Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies
many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to
overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S
clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been
gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of
unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95
likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since
gas expulsion.

                        We present phosphorus abundance measurements for a total of 102 giant stars,
including 82 stars in 24 open clusters and 20 Cepheids, based on
high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with GIANO-B. Evolution of
phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance,
remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining
precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and
measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines.
Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around
solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies.
We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr,
indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained
by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more
efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher
phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters
younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly
hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass
stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common
chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass
stars.

                        Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components
usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios
were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary
interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings
valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars.
We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the
detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a
dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality
photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we
found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other
systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here
are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are
therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in
the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in
these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature,
rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high
incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong
constraints for star formation models.

                        Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active
star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at
different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to
study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies,
the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$)
among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive
star evolution.
  Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars,
and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate
whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0,
are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the
observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2.
  Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in
Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical
spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using
iacob-broad.
  Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in
fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show
$v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this
threshold.
  Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack
of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three
factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may
imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions;
(ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway
stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation
(reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at
birth.

                        Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers
of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the
most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be
the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated
debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important
constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field
stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a
group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We
analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a
8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match
those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum
of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the
e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted
streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars
chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich,
consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show
kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional
stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC
6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties
between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings
indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular
cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor.
Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky
coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and
dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner
Galaxy.

                        Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM).
Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with
high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical
wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method
based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the
previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective
mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust
structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate
extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying
XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey,
we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that
span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l <
232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and
300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers
higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions
compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane,
providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.

                        A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear
star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC
7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old
stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the
old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of
metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The
young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all
galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.
Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar
age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the
average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include
contributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of
the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population
synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust
lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of
interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar
clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar
winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of
extinction are detected.

                        Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-$z$ star-forming galaxies
depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has
not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm
log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and
high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a
meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$
FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$
[OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at
$z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})
\lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady
state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak
positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these
systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm
eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$
correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical
and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario
where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before
subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot
lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary
process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems,
regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the
canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star
formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z
\gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim
0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.

                        While massive quiescent galaxies are known to be poor in atomic hydrogen
(HI), their true HI content remains poorly constrained due to the limited
sensitivity and morphological biases of existing surveys. We present deep HI
observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent
galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast > 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color
(NUV$-r > 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of
$\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the
predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the
majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$
upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) < -3.46$ derived from stacking the
non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high
fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation
with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST
sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only
includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and
its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three
different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions,
background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in
the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type
morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs,
neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that
additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI
deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.
