                        We present an overview of the final data release (DR2) from the Green Bank
Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map
all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 7$~mag visible
from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key molecular
tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed:
Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333,
L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A
(North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis
(CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar
to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH$_3$ emission and dust
continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH$_3$
emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense
cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent
cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common
throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the
high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity
dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$
column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the
NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_{\rm kin}$, vary systematically
between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean
value and spread of $\sigma_v$ and $T_{\rm kin}$ with increasing star formation
activity. The data presented in this paper are publicly available via
\dataset[DOI: 10.11570/24.0091]{https://doi.org/10.11570/24.0091}.

                        We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward
G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope
and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were
detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper
energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot
molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation
temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five
percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas
(100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the
interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency
in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central
molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented
here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular
gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the
shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the
nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that
shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing
galactic evolution.

                        Young stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, but older stars are
evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for
cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular
clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides,
caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial
direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and
drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and
remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the
cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing
exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} =
\sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's
density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides
can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like
elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish
cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.

                        Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide
range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The
formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within
them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular,
the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and
prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we
conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant
molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the
interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving
down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By
introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas
during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how
much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the
gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is
gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the
warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular
clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$
cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas
on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions
assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven
supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small
contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.

                        We present results from a dual narrow-band imaging survey targeting the
CL1604 supercluster at z = 0.9 using the Subaru Telescope. By combining the
NB921 filter on HSC and the NB1244 filter on SWIMS, we can detect redshifted
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines from the supercluster. This unique
technique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction
for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that
dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$
ratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas
relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among
galaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$), the
dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main
sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this
relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density
environments. Although stellar mass, SFR, and galaxy color are clearly
influenced by environment, we detect no strong, systematic environmental
dependence of dust extinction for the whole sample.

                        Understanding how the Milky Way's present-day structure was shaped by past
major mergers is a key goal of Galactic archaeology. The chemical and dynamical
structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major
accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day
orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the
merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological
zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages,
and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that
stars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and
chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and
metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al.
(2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context.
The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as
[Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The
median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar,
though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported
by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest
metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained
across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like
a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion
space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched
core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of
accreted stars.

                        We present the Blue Jay survey, a Cycle-1 JWST program aimed at studying the
stellar and gas content of galaxies at Cosmic Noon. The survey consists of deep
spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field
using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three
medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13
hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of
the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength
range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over
the redshift range 1.7 < z < 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar
mass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 Msun.The Blue Jay sample is
representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without
strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of
massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters,
which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations.
Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we
construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of
the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets
consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a
substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure
multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different
ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from
the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This
enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue
Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for
studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon
galaxies.

                        Stellar feedback drives winds and outflows critical to the baryon cycles of
low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them
particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However,
spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited
due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot
of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying
stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally
resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for
outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical
imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA
21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST
photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas
morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate
spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy
is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong
outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though
star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the
galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to
produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling
outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how
stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper
understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar
medium in low-mass galaxies.
