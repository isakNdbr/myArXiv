                        We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density
profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the
notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are
modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically
symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its
surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating
isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear
partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown
fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a
steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of
leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is
$\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the
centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our
dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those
found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our
previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid
element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre
are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or
transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)
or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the
accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,
under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with
$\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the
density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an
attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.

                        Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,
without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster
census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We
create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic
cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster
census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different
spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters
as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's
selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into
Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We
find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,
extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older
clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper
motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection
effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a
Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite
positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher
scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot
be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the
Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at
least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We
predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be
discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be
explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster
destruction rate in the anticentre.

                        Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of
large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and
line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative
model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based
generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark
matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences
of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the
halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo --
conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation,
the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including
the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and
redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations
of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock
LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast
DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can
be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy
lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population.
The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to
develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.

                        We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into
multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO
(3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to
identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have
significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios.
Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas
inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from
non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing
process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast
can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength
of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the
hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous
studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the
gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the
networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main
star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the
hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that
feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic
properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in
our previous studies.

                        Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the
correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to
significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy
dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby
galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical
models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address
this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art
MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR
framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star
formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple
analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point
spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find
that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface
density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and
logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with
indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes
of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and
effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of
the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles,
allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume
density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations
for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for
comparison with multi-wavelength observations.

                        We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24
redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen
lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines
exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample
when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the
presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves
exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the
offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv
values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest
variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust
covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line
ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation
curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and
thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be
accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way
sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated
measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel
constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in
turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering
fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including
the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and
Lyman continuum radiation.

                        The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several
million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical
and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their
associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$
observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming
galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central
region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy
presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and
then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between
the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm
gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of
${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm
log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these
sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is
associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of
star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and
stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the
$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial
scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics
of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The
diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas,
stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although
these relations show relatively large scatter.

                        This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the
local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations.
We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the
local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization
simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict
collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first
all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$,
[NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions
only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry
out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent
metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing
features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very
local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370
$\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the
observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a
factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate
required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas,
possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding
the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their
ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely
ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the
leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of
ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

                        The new generation of optical spectrographs (i.e., WEAVE, 4MOST, DESI, and
WST) offer unprecedented opportunities for statistically studying the star
formation histories of galaxies. However, these observations are not easily
comparable to predictions from cosmological simulations. Our goal is to build a
reference framework for comparing spectroscopic observations with simulations
and test tools for deriving stellar population properties of galaxies. We focus
on the observational strategy of the Stellar Population at Intermediate
Redshift Survey (StePS) with the WEAVE instrument. We generate mock datasets of
~750 galaxies at redshifts z = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 using the TNG50 simulation,
perform radiative transfer with SKIRT, and analyze the spectra with pPXF as if
they were real observations. We present the methodology to generate these
datasets and provide an initial exploration of stellar population parameters
(i.e., mass-weighted ages and metallicities) and star formation histories for
three galaxies at z = 0.7 and their descendants at z = 0.5 and 0.3. We find
good agreement between the mock spectra and intrinsic ages in TNG50 (average
difference $0.2\pm0.3$ Gyr) and successfully recover their star formation
histories, especially for galaxies form the bulk of their stars on short
timescales and at early epochs. We release these datasets, including
multi-wavelength imaging and spectra, to support forthcoming WEAVE
observations.

                        The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for
several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal
complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in
the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two
such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and
topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of
superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of
filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of
spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components.
The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line
profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution
and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare
molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm
line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used
to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity
diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The
unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to
superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1
km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures
with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths
of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is
embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients
found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows.
Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that
mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.
