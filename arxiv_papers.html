                        Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and
plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to
accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from
position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method
calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity
dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin
conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the
present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence
turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical
simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO
(2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the
first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO
results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT
impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity
dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO,
with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88
(+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements
of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential
overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.

                        Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the
initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to
investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas
phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great
interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw
material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward
four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust
temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps
to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70,
G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion
factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer,
lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and
f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO
depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10
in regions with $n_H>3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter
at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with
temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional
form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and
$T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily
depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion
can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by
factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption
in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing
important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical
history of gas during the early stages of star formation.

                        We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate
interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While
our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also
predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed
sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given
density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing
quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time
throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column
density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably
accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore
the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column
density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate
densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to
decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our
simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find
this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and
embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is
significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the
relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several
possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly
constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the
sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence"
is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law
velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight
path lengths.

                        We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$
Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography
Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic
redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO,
zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured
cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as
observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived
redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected
from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR
emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of
`fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our
foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated
stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For
sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) =
[9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$,
respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck
$N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* /
M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass
end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with
predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based
observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.

                        Aims. The aim of this work is to determine the maximum ages that can be
unambiguously established for $\delta$ Sct stars using seismic observables,
and, by extension, the oldest open clusters that can be dated using this type
of star. Methods. I estimate the large frequency separation using various
techniques applied to two samples of $\delta$ Sct located near the red edge of
the instability strip. One sample consists of 18 targets observed by the Kepler
mission, and the other comprises 17 targets observed by TESS. I employ a grid
of stellar models representative of typical $\delta$ Sct parameters,
incorporating mass, metallicity, and rotation as independent variables, and
compute the first eight radial modes for each model. Using the observed
spectroscopic temperature, and the estimated large separation, I estimate the
age of each star by fitting a weighted probability density function to the age
distribution of the models that best match the seismic constraints. Results. To
evaluate the performance of the fitting method, it was applied to a synthetic
population of 20 $\delta$ Sct stars with varying metallicities and ages,
generated by randomly selecting models. The analysis indicates that $\delta$
Sct stars older than 1 Gyr, but still prior to reaching the terminal-age main
sequence, can in principle be reliably age-dated. Nevertheless, when the method
is applied to the observational sample, only three out of the 35 stars
considered marginally exceed an estimated age of 1 Gyr. Conclusions. From these
results, I can say that open clusters older than approximately 1 Gyr cannot be
reliably dated using astero-seismology of $\delta$ Sct stars with 1D models, at
least not without a more complete treatment of convection and a non-linear
treatment of rotation.

                        Although asteroseismology is regarded as the most powerful tool for probing
stellar interiors, seismic modelling remains dependent on global stellar
parameters. Stellar clusters offer direct measurements of these parameters by
fitting a CMD, making the application of asteroseismology in clusters a
valuable approach to advancing stellar physics modelling. We aimed to develop
seismic modelling for gravity-mode pulsators in the open cluster NGC 2516 to
determine stellar ages. We computed 1D stellar models using MESA, incorporating
rotation-induced transport processes. Exponential overshooting was included, as
well as rotationally induced mixing in the radiative envelope. Grids of
evolutionary models were computed covering isochrone-derived mass ranges. The
models were evolved up to 300 Myr because of the cluster's young age (~100Myr).
By fitting the frequencies of identified modes of four gravity-mode member
pulsators simultaneously, we measure the seismic age of the cluster NGC 2516 as
132+-8Myr. This high-precision seismic age estimate deviates by 1sigma from the
isochronal age derived from public MIST isochrones for rotating stars. Our
findings show that seismic modelling strongly constrains core overshooting, but
because the period spacing patterns are smooth, it provides weak constraints on
mixing in the radiative envelopes. The two most massive gravity-mode pulsators
have MIST masses ~2.0M_sun while their seismic masses are 1.75M_sun. We
constructed new asteroseismology-calibrated isochrones using input physics
identical to that of our seismic model grid. While this resolves the age
discrepancy, the mass discrepancy is only partially addressed. The remaining
small yet persisting mass discrepancy implies a mismatch between the physics in
core to surface environments of 1D stellar models and the seismic observables
probing those areas of fast-rotating stars.

                        As sites of some of the most efficient star formation in the Universe,
globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks
of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution
of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in
nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be
identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We
identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using
integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo
stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level
exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field.
Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations
with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many
nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a
sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O]
stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than
energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC
origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of
low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control
dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O]
stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and
the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of
precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster
tagging.

                        To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have
relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present
the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the
VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona
Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the
morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image
registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values
($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good
agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the
region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for
directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new
window into the study of cloud dynamics.

                        The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile
variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the
unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of
profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the
blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars
across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the
DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components
within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits
being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other
regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We
propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the
distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the
broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum
within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance
from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection
between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent
supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile
variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern
area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition
to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show
consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median
over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the
blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and
argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved
kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of
the band.

                        The Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of
their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able
to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z > 3) and thus measure
their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha)
calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift
galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty
star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha
luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha)
calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z > 3 with
minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of
star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with
JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations,
taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar
metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha)
calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean
squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.04 dex
and $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST
NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new
calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the
estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by $\Delta\rho$(SFR)
$\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence
increases by $\Delta$ $\partial$log SFR / $\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02.

                        Spectral line surveys of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) have led to the
detection of more than 100 new molecular species, making it the most prolific
source of interstellar molecular discoveries. These wide-band, high-sensitivity
line surveys have been enabled by advances in telescope and receiver
technology, particularly at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In this
work, we present a statistical analysis of the molecular inventory of TMC-1 as
probed by the GOTHAM large program survey from 3.9 to 36.4 GHz. To fully unlock
the potential of the $\sim$29 GHz spectral bandwidth, we developed an automated
pipeline for data reduction and calibration. We applied a Bayesian approach
with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the calibrated spectra and constrained
column densities for 102 molecular species detected in TMC-1, including 75 main
isotopic species, 20 carbon-13 substituted species, and seven
deuterium-substituted species. This list of the detected gas-phase molecules is
populated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, in stark contrast to the oxygen-rich
organics found in sublimated ices around protostars. Of note, ten individual
aromatic molecules were identified in the GOTHAM observations, contributing
0.011% of the gas-phase carbon budget probed by detected molecules when
including CO and 6% when excluding CO. This work provides a reference set of
observed gas-phase molecular abundances for interstellar clouds, offering a new
benchmark for astrochemical theoretical models.

                        Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial
for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the
large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of
3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust
reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive
parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and
includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size,
mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our
catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740
clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high
Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the
cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk,
including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more
detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our
understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and
provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog
serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic
structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM
features.
