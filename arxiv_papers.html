                        In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality
of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145
singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size,
concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal
dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters.
Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are
generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally
concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in
clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal
substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly,
median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups
(1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings
indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context
significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve
toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less
massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study
demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with
the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and
dynamical state.

                        LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the
Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as
catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region,
which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth
analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne
Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to
observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the
C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each
of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic
temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute
the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical
insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of
mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess
the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified
clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion
(RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our
results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within
the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low
interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps
independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional
compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of
RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the
instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

                        Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their
formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of
the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass,
envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against
observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the
near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the
inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to
yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image
profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of
protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR
images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA
Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via
comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting
pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined
with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties.
We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A,
finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED
fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more
distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST
limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher
resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand
the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.

                        Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The
clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense
embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas
expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On
the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at
a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the
densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected
for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star
formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent
estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have
applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law
that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The
second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest
OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local
values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between
$736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$,
depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than
previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the
incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$
50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring
in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from
the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with
clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

                        We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue,
aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive
stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars,
incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3
(DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog
based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric
corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry,
ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this
stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some
comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous
versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with
competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective
temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the
challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we
explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms,
spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt).
Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with
upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation
of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our
understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This
catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community,
supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other
processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.

                        The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important
theoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events
trigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to
interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked
a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection
between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which
describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We
show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal
Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF
parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying
assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new
approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling
observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP
framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time
models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.

                        We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a
prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial
scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of
molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a
wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B
and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal
tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0)
luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$,
corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$
assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation
efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to
or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a
velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low,
mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the
ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity
component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our
mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner
tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of
total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation.
While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail,
our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.

                        Intermediate-mass galaxies, including the Milky Way, typically host both a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC). Binaries in
an NSC evolve via close encounters with surrounding stars and secular processes
related to the SMBH. We study moderately soft and hard binaries
($0.03$-$2.5\,\mathrm{au}$, $M \lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) initially at
galactocentric radii 0.1 and 0.3 pc using three-body simulations including von
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations and tidal dissipation over $\sim 10$ Gyr.
Binaries migrate both inward and outward as a consequence of kicks received in
the three-body encounters. Inward migration leads to destruction via mergers
and evaporation, while outward migration is a pathway to retaining intact
binaries for $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr. All surviving binaries are hard and circular,
but outcomes for binaries initially at the hard-soft boundary are stochastic.
We find that: (i) about $0.3$ percent of evaporated binaries fall into the
SMBH's loss cone, (ii) at least $1$ percent of mergers occur late enough to
appear as blue straggler stars (BSSs) on the main sequence or as recently
evolved red giants, (iii) about $1$ percent of binaries initially at 0.1 pc
merge within the inner arcsec of the NSC, and (iv) less than about $80$ percent
of field-star collisions with a binary star lead to a subsequent merger; a
three-body pile up, which are relatively common in the first 1-2 Gyr and could
serve as a way to form more massive BSSs in the NSC. We predict that a small
fraction of binaries originate closer to the SMBH than their present-day
orbits, and vice versa for evaporated binaries and BSSs. The mergers confined
to the inner arcsec occur after $\gtrsim 300$ Myr, too long to be directly
related to the formation of the S-stars or G-objects, but suggest that the
inner arcsec is contaminated with BSSs from earlier star formation events.

                        This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the
Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with
astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a
machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and
chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$,
$\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of
metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for
Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution
model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the
$\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas
mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus,
placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model
scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a
rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a
lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data
in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this
scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way.
Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in
Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier
inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of
chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient
accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star
formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the
metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.
