                        The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main sequence stars challenges
standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem which
extends to Li depletion in solar analogs and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars
within open clusters. Building on the meridional circulation-driven radial
mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars,
we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our
models reproduce the observed $A(\text{Li})$-Age correlation in solar analogs.
Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the
simulated and observed $A(\text{Li})$-$T_{\text{eff}}$ relationships within the
solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance ($\sim
1.5\,\text{dex}$) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our
models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The
models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in
most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems
like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models' ability to
fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity
distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.

                        We investigate the effects of ram-pressure stripping on four galaxies within
the massive, strong-lensing cluster MACS-J0138.0-2155 ($z=0.336$). Of these,
three are classified as jellyfish galaxies, with significant elongated tails.
Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping
and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation
only in the tails. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we
spatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas
associated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with
optical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize
the galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all
blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few
hundred $\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails. From the resolved gas
kinematics, we derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates; these are generally
low reaching a maximum of approximately 0.49
$\mathrm{M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}kpc^{-2}}$ in galaxy J3. We also report the
kinematics for galaxy J4, which lies in the foreground of the cluster but close
in projection to one of the lensed arcs.

                        We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$)
quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the
evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights
on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust
sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS
database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their
mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the
CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time
since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain
insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in
our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of
cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently
quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority
of QGs observed at $z<1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of
time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$)
are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM,
while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term
effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust
mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in
high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and
significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming
galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after
quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs
already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a
gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.

                        Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk
galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical
evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for
external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day
radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar
radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates.
In the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated
by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading
impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very
central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a
net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk,
migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are
overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward,
whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they
themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed
and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically
underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have
direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys
such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for
stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk
mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius
estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.

                        Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact
morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure
across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we
performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive
$(\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0<z<4$ with public James
Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public
Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early
Release Science Survey. We find that at $z \sim 3.5$, the half-mass radius is
about 5.4 times smaller than at $z \sim 0.5$. This growth is driven by stellar
mass buildup in the outskirts ($r > 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \sim
1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to
local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to
explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass
accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the
size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as
$\log(R_{e,mass}) \propto \alpha \log(M_*)$, and find $\alpha =
2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by
minor mergers, and $\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\gtrapprox2$,
consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that
massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow
through combinations of minor and major mergers.

                        Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple
evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution
as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition
before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may
either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture
supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear
burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron
core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the
production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of
these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various
sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the
strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a
consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C
and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP
coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about
1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the
minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot
higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova
light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production
within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as
deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would
require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a
moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced
mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.
