                        Although the majority of star-forming galaxies show a tight correlation
between stellar mass and dust extinction, recent James Webb Space Telescope
observations have revealed a peculiar population of Highly Extincted Low-Mass
(HELM) galaxies, which could revolutionise our understanding of dust production
mechanisms. To fully understand the dust content of these galaxies, which are a
minority of the overall galaxy population, far-infrared observations over large
areas are pivotal. In this paper, we derive the expected PRIMAger, the far-IR
(24-235$\mu m$) imaging camera proposed for the Probe far-IR Mission for
Astrophysics, fluxes for a set of photometric candidates HELM galaxies. Taking
into account a deep survey of 1000h over $1\rm\, deg^{2}$, we expect to detect
around $3.1 \times 10^4$ HELM sources in at least one PRIMAger filter, 100 of
which are at z=1-1.5. For 32% of this sample, there will be observations in at
least four PRIMAger filters, covering at least the 90 to $240\mu m$ wavelength
range, which will allow us to obtain a detailed fit of the dust emission and
estimate the dust mass.

                        The Roman Space Telescope will be instrumental for characterizing the
physical properties of galaxies and understanding their evolution across time.
However, a complete view of galaxy star formation activity will only be
possible with the addition of far-infrared observations that a telescope such
as PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be able to provide.
Indeed, PRIMA's far-infrared camera will be highly sensitive to dust emission,
whereas Roman will probe the stellar emission in rest-frame optical and
ultraviolet of distant galaxies. Our aim here is to evaluate the advantage of
combining large PRIMA and Roman extragalactic surveys to retrieve the physical
properties of galaxies and compare them with what we would obtain using either
dataset separately. To do so, we use the Code Investigating Galaxy Emission
photometric modeling code to generate a far-ultraviolet to a far-infrared
synthetic set of dusty star-forming galaxies at redshifts from 1.5 to 2.5,
simulating the observations from the main extragalactic surveys of PRIMA and
Roman. We find that the PRIMA + Roman observations can reliably retrieve the
star formation rate, stellar masses, and dust luminosity.

                        Sulfur is known to undergo severe depletion when moving from diffuse clouds
to the denser regimes of the interstellar medium in molecular clouds. The form
in which sulfur gets depleted onto dust grains, however, remains a mystery. One
possibility is that sulfur gets locked in interstellar dust in the form of
sulfide minerals. Recently, metal sulfides such as NaS and MgS have been
detected in a shocked molecular cloud in the Galactic Center, suggesting that
these molecules could represent an important reservoir of sulfur in dust
grains. In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal
sulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the
FIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode. Our
estimates show that the molecular bands of MgS and FeS found between 20 and 50
${\mu}$m could be detected in absorption with S/N ${\geq}$ 5 for sources
brighter than 200 mJy in just 1 h of observing time against low-mass
protostellar objects. This science case, therefore, has the potential to unveil
the main reservoir of sulfur in interstellar dust, constraining in what form
sulfur is incorporated into minor bodies of our solar system.

                        Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most
metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first
stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However,
no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The
high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]>[C/Fe]>[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between
Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom
burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of
the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was
well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed
chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of
hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances
of HE 1327. Our 3 Msun models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327.
They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only
discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB
models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb,
which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is
the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB
stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and
polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations
support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively
consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr
after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar
medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early
epochs.

                        Spiral arms play a central role in disc galaxies, but their dynamical nature
remains a long-standing open question. Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas
and star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by
quasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between
CO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that
display a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial
scatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a
coherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha
peaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this
convention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a
few hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets
become smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single
quasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean
offsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple
overlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no
significantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical
spirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral
perturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between
CO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often
crosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive
offsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with
the literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals
in the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical
mechanisms.

                        We derive and analyse the star formation histories of 393
intermediate-redshift (0.1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.9) galaxies with stellar masses
between $\sim$10$^{8}$ - 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. We probe a cosmic time of
approximately 6 Gyr and a range of environments, from field (low-density
systems) to rich groups (high-density systems). We find that the galaxies'
stellar mean ages, metallicities, and star formation rates (SFRs) follow
similar trends to galaxies as those characterising the nearby Universe. We
modelled the derived SFRs, quantifying and characterising the number of
star-forming episodes (SFEs). We found that more than 85$\%$ of the galaxies
have more than one event of star formation, typically described with an
exponentially decaying SFR and subsequent Gaussian-like episode(s) of star
formation. We also observe that massive galaxies have fewer SFEs than low-mass
systems and that they form their stellar mass and reach quiescence faster than
lower mass galaxies. Moreover, the history of mass assembly for the most
massive galaxies in the sample can be described with only one episode of star
formation in the early Universe, which we detected as an exponential decrease
that was longer in duration than subsequent SF events. This early event has
typically been completed by z$\sim$3 and it accounts for a high fraction of the
total stellar mass, from $\sim$40$\%$ for low-mass galaxies to more than 50$\%$
for higher-mass galaxies. We also analysed the dependence of stellar population
parameters with the various environments probed by the sample, finding no
significant correlations between different group environments; however, our
field galaxies are generally distinct from group galaxies in terms of the mass,
metallicity, stellar ages, and formation timescales. We discuss possible biases
in the sample selection and examine how representative our galaxies are of the
overall galaxy population.

                        Acetamide (CH$_{3}$CONH$_{2}$), a key interstellar amide and a methyl
derivative of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO), has been sparsely detected, limiting
insights into its prebiotic relevance. We present the first systematic survey
for acetamide toward 52 hot molecular cores using ALMA Band 6 data. Acetamide
has been detected in 10 cores, markedly expanding the inventory of known
emitters. The derived column densities of acetamide range from
$(2.5\pm0.9)\times10^{14}$ to $(1.5\pm0.6)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, compared to
formamide's $(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ to $(6.9\pm0.4)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$.
The nearly constant abundance ratios (~3-9) and strong abundance correlation
between the two amides across sources suggest a chemically linked formation
pathway, likely on grain surfaces. The presence of peptide-like molecules in
these regions implies that complex organic species can survive star formation
processes, offering a potential pathway toward prebiotic chemistry. These
findings constrain the dominant grain surface formation routes of acetamide,
confirm its broader prevalence in highmass star-forming regions, and underscore
the importance of targeted amide surveys in tracing the chemical evolution
toward prebiotic complexity.

                        We present the first comprehensive catalogs of $^{13}$CO clumps from the
Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By developing an equivalent
global detection scheme integrated with the FacetClumps algorithm, we
successfully extract 71,661 molecular clumps across a high-resolution $^{13}$CO
data cube spanning 2310 deg$^2$ from the MWISP Phase I survey. To determine
accurate distances, we design an automatic hierarchical distance decision
method using signal regions as fundamental objects, effectively resolving the
kinematic distance ambiguity problem and obtaining reliable measurements for
97.94% of the sample. Statistical analysis reveals that 65.3% of clumps are
gravitationally bound, accounting for approximately 96.3% of the statistical
total mass. Scaling relation analysis across multiple surveys reveals universal
power-law behaviors in clump populations. Maser-associated clumps exhibit
modified parameter distributions and scaling relations, revealing how active
star formation alters clump dynamics and structure. These extensive catalogs
establish a foundation for investigating molecular clump properties, star
formation processes, and Galactic evolution.

                        The QCD phase transition in the early universe may provide primordial black
hole nuclei for globular clusters. We consider the accretion and star formation
that follow, once 1000 solar mass nuclei have formed. When such a nucleus has
formed, it remains. Whether these are common in the oldest globular clusters is
one decidedly challenging question for the model, which is, as yet, unanswered;
another is a possible contribution to the cosmic gravitational radiation
background.

                        The integrated luminosity from the features of the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) exceeds the luminosity from atomic and molecular emission
lines in the star-forming regions in galaxies and is a potential tracer of
galaxy-scale star formation and molecular gas content of the high-redshift
universe. We simulate the observable PAH spectra using the PRobe far-Infrared
Mission for Astrophysics far-infrared enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS) and
investigate the capability of the FIRESS low-resolution spectroscopy for
observing PAH emission spectrum from high-redshift galaxies. Our investigation
suggests that (1) PRIMA observations of PAH emission are $\gtrsim10$ times more
efficient at detecting galaxies than the VLA observations of CO(1-0) for
galaxies with the same infrared luminosity, (2) PRIMA/FIRESS can detect the PAH
emission from galaxies with $L_{IR}\sim10^{12}L_{\odot}$ up to the end of
reionization (and possibly beyond, if $L_{IR}\sim10^{13}L_{\odot}$), (3) the
PAH band ratios measured from a full spectral fitting and from a simple flux
"clipping" method are different and vary depending on the interstellar
radiation field strength, and (4) PRIMA/FIRESS can also be used as the PAH
mapping instrument to measure star formation and redshift of the galaxies in
high-redshift protoclusters.

                        It has been suggested that, if the free-fall time of star-forming clouds is
shorter than the lifetime ($\approx 3 $ Myr) of massive stars exploding as
supernovae (SN), a large fraction of the cloud gas can be converted into stars
during an allegedly `feedback-free' phase. Here, we show that radiation
pressure from Ly$\alpha$ photons produced in the pre-SN phase can instead erase
feedback-free conditions, and severely limit the star formation efficiency
(SFE). We find that, for a constant star formation rate, all clouds with gas
surface density $(37-1.7 \times 10^5)\ M_\odot\ \rm pc^{-2}$ have $\epsilon_* <
0.08$. Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\alpha$-driven shells
fragment and form stars. While advanced RHD simulations are required to
establish the importance of this effect, adopting an optimistic guess, we find
that the SFE increases with cloud surface density, rising from
$\epsilon_*=0.023$ at $\Sigma_g = 37\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$ to
$\epsilon_*=0.27$ at $\Sigma_g = 1.7 \times 10^5\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$.
Given the optimistic assumptions adopted, these numbers should be regarded as
upper limits. We conclude that Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure strongly limits
the SFE, even at solar metallicities, erasing the possibility that a
feedback-free star formation mode with $\epsilon_* \gtrsim 0.4$ exists in the
pre-SN phase. This conclusion remains valid even when other effects such as
dust destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons, presence of HII regions, velocity
gradients, atomic recoil, and turbulence are considered.

                        The Milky Way's (MW's) star formation history (SFH) offers insight into the
chronology of its assembly and the mechanisms driving its structural
development. In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the
spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both
stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar
disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to
trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into
account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy
exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z > 2$ ($\rm R_{\rm eff}
\approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and
grew to a present-day size of $\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary
peak in SFR $\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc,
which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ
star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is
characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out
growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our
work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar
sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.

                        Not all galaxies at Cosmic Noon evolve in the same way. It remains unclear
how the local environment -- especially the extreme overdensities of
protoclusters -- affects stellar mass assembly at high redshift. The stellar
mass function (SMF) encodes these processes; comparing SMFs across environments
reveals differences in evolutionary history. We present the SMF of the Hyperion
proto-supercluster at $z\sim2.5$, one of the largest and most massive
protostructures known. This dataset provides the most statistically robust SMF
of a single protostructure at $z>2$. By comparing the SMF of overdense peaks
within Hyperion to the coeval field, we ask: how early, and how strongly, does
a dense environment favor massive galaxies? Using COSMOS2020 photometry with
ground-based and new HST grism spectroscopy, we construct a 3D overdensity map
that assigns galaxies to peaks, outskirts, or the field. We perform 100 Monte
Carlo realizations to propagate redshift and mass uncertainties, and derive
SMFs normalized to the field. The peaks show a clear excess of massive
galaxies: number densities at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 11$ are ~10x higher than
the field, while those at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim 9.5$ are enhanced by only
~3.5x. By contrast, the outskirts and Hyperion as a whole mirror the field.
Environmental effects on stellar mass growth are thus evident by $z\sim 2.5$.
The densest regions already host galaxies with accelerated growth, while the
global SMF masks this signal. Protostructures therefore begin shaping the
high-mass end of the SMF well before cluster quenching, and may drive the
elevated star formation at Cosmic Noon.

                        Observing and characterizing pre- and protostellar cores in the earliest and
densest stages of star formation is challenging due to their short timescales
and high densities, limiting the suitable tracers and targets. We conducted
ALMA-Atacama Compact Array (ACA) stand-alone observations of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$
(1$_{\rm 1,0}$-1$_{\rm 1,1}$) emission, which is believed to trace cold
high-density regions, toward three dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud:
(1) L1544, likely in the densest prestellar phase; (2) MC 35-mm, a candidate
for the first hydrostatic core; and (3) MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0
very-low luminosity object. These observations provide high angular resolution
data for the line across a set of cores selected to represent consecutive
stages around the onset of star formation, offering a unique opportunity to
trace the time evolution of $\sim$10$^4$ years. With the single-dish
total-power array, we detected ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ emission in all three cores,
revealing its presence over scales of $\sim$10,000 au. In the interferometric 7
m array data with a beam size of 3.$''$5 ($\sim$500\,au), emission was detected
only toward the central continuum source of MC 35-mm, with a significance of
$\sim$3$\sigma$. No significant detections were found in the other targets,
placing an upper limit on the H$_2$D$^{+}$ abundance of $\sim$10$^{-11}$ in the
dense components traced by the interferometric continuum emission. These
results suggest that ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ predominantly exhibits an extended
distribution over several thousand au in the early stages of star formation.
Detection in compact, dense central structures may only be achieved within a
few $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years immediately before or after protostar formation.

                        We present a new catalogue of 578 OB cluster (OBC) candidates in the
Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's
F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al.
2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc
and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star
formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry:
clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular
clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but
less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate
significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial
association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense
gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early
evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across
galactic discs.
