                        The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass
star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro
objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of
the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the
westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a
complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra
field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique
X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray
properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR
photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of
young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray
sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The
known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not.
Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source
are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the
nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains
speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder
for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma
dark cloud.

                        The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star
formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster
members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant
uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young
Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 <
l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation
in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on
2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm
to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte
Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO
astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the
Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust
membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in
higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In
this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters
with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new
members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars
in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership
probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more
accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within
uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data,
and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

                        Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to
become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial
element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear
rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts,
remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the
Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy
morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the
nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed
rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust
lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple
armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope
images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings
are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+
rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand
design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with
later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In
addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear
spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the
nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host
galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a
fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the
nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg
structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very
weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate
cases.

                        Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between
fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation,
self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these
processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10
Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at
100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI
emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes
using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on
studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of
these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for
the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer.
We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by
Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong
criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and
derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$
and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94
Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to
study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and
kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how
stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic
gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then
unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

                        It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at
high-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their
formation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a
sample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the
OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission.
These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with
star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps
with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit
low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70
km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses
inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also
artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a
direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate
that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations,
high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores
the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier
epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in
star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc
as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or
gravitational lensing.

                        We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide
range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen
abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to
density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,
compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those
of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV
nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic
time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns
with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that
galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant
redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between
electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure
contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with
high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong
correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity
outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to
elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results
highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young
stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for
interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.
