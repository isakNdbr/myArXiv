                        Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 association exists a
region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia
astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups,
all found in a similar location in the sky ($137 \lessapprox l\lessapprox145$
and $-2\lessapprox b \lessapprox5$) and at a similar distance ($\sim$1kpc). In
this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this
region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time,
examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering
of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available
SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr
with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters
overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on
present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct
region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the
clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association,
with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus
arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this
work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a
different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel
through the Galaxy.

                        Context. Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been
widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive
star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack
of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI]
lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used
observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885
sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between
line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm
L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit
the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII
lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses
is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other.
For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm
{M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} =
3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ ,
respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of
SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm
L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and
0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method,
we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and
CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across
different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these
correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.

                        Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming
galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the
circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of
spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model
circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$
emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and
temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the
neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV)
background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three
types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems
with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a
neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in
between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative
transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of
Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and
the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based
on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT
simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy
at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable
recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical
information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$
emission.

                        Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that
interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from
enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star
formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting
cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star
formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features
located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar
populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the
stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,
with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations
are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst
aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star
clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star
formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In
the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and
cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star
formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds
associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the
halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star
formation, producing the observed episodic structure.

                        How does molecular cloud chemistry change with metallicity? In this work, we
study the relation between molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) and carbon monoxide (CO)
at $1/2$ and $1/5$ solar metallicity using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy
obtained as part of the UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards
(ULLYSES) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program. We determine CO column
densities or upper limits for a sample of 50 lines of sight through the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). $^{12}$CO is detected along eight
lines of sight and $^{13}$CO is detected along two. Combining our new CO column
densities with $N_{H_2}$ measurements from the literature, we find that the
evolution of $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ from the Milky Way to the LMC and SMC is a
relatively shallow function of metallicity. Taking $N_{CO}>3\times10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ as a threshold value above which CO emission is likely to be
detectable at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds, the $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ at
which a sightline has a 50% probability of having $N_{CO}$ above this threshold
is 20.8 in the Milky Way, 20.9 in the LMC, and 21.1 in the SMC. This is an 0.3
dex change in threshold $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ over an 0.7 dex change in
metallicity. We compare our measurements with $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ relations from
literature chemical models and find that the measured relations agree best with
models in which the dynamical timescale is longer than the chemical timescale
for $H_2$ but shorter than the chemical timescale for CO.

                        We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a
starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is
triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated
with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b
(v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between
0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9".
The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an
intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the
component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s
component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the
complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features
of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes
of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps
belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time
of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600
km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced
SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas
compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF
in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in
more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas
accompanied by blast-wave shocks.
