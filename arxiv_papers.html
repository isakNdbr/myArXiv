                        Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to
observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust
grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and
$\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and
spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards
hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation.
However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and
quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex
spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE),
a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice
absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice
fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$,
$\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To
train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures
from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and
normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional
computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR
absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species
fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38
and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program,
demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice
composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic
analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In
addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data,
improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted
species.

                        The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on
which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous
estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested
that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we
have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints,
we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the
geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to
compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova
remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates,
$\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the
momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made
available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054923. Previous estimates of the
age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the
number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the
assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby
Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars
at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new
evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in
the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have
instead quenched it.

                        Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and
plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to
accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from
position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method
calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity
dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin
conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the
present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence
turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical
simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO
(2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the
first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO
results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT
impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity
dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO,
with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88
(+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements
of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential
overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.

                        Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the
initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to
investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas
phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great
interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw
material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward
four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust
temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps
to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70,
G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion
factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer,
lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and
f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO
depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10
in regions with $n_H>3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter
at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with
temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional
form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and
$T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily
depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion
can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by
factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption
in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing
important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical
history of gas during the early stages of star formation.

                        Observing and characterizing pre- and protostellar cores in the earliest and
densest stages of star formation is challenging due to their short timescales
and high densities, limiting the suitable tracers and targets. We conducted
ALMA-Atacama Compact Array (ACA) stand-alone observations of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$
(1$_{\rm 1,0}$-1$_{\rm 1,1}$) emission, which is believed to trace cold
high-density regions, toward three dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud:
(1) L1544, likely in the densest prestellar phase; (2) MC 35-mm, a candidate
for the first hydrostatic core; and (3) MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0
very-low luminosity object. These observations provide high angular resolution
data for the line across a set of cores selected to represent consecutive
stages around the onset of star formation, offering a unique opportunity to
trace the time evolution of $\sim$10$^4$ years. With the single-dish
total-power array, we detected ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ emission in all three cores,
revealing its presence over scales of $\sim$10,000 au. In the interferometric 7
m array data with a beam size of 3.$''$5 ($\sim$500\,au), emission was detected
only toward the central continuum source of MC 35-mm, with a significance of
$\sim$3$\sigma$. No significant detections were found in the other targets,
placing an upper limit on the H$_2$D$^{+}$ abundance of $\sim$10$^{-11}$ in the
dense components traced by the interferometric continuum emission. These
results suggest that ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ predominantly exhibits an extended
distribution over several thousand au in the early stages of star formation.
Detection in compact, dense central structures may only be achieved within a
few $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years immediately before or after protostar formation.

                        We present a new catalogue of 578 OB cluster (OBC) candidates in the
Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's
F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al.
2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc
and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star
formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry:
clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular
clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but
less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate
significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial
association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense
gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early
evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across
galactic discs.

                        We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs),
rotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both
early- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics,
stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We
derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and
compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The
relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including
nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role
of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted,
emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such
as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves
as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve
individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics,
dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of
a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue
that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven
gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas
during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions,
future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming
observational facilities.

                        As sites of some of the most efficient star formation in the Universe,
globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks
of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution
of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in
nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be
identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We
identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using
integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo
stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level
exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field.
Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations
with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many
nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a
sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O]
stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than
energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC
origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of
low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control
dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O]
stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and
the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of
precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster
tagging.

                        To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have
relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present
the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the
VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona
Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the
morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image
registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values
($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good
agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the
region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for
directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new
window into the study of cloud dynamics.

                        The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile
variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the
unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of
profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the
blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars
across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the
DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components
within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits
being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other
regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We
propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the
distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the
broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum
within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance
from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection
between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent
supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile
variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern
area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition
to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show
consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median
over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the
blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and
argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved
kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of
the band.
