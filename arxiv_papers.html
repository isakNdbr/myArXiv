                        While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation
has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner
galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young
massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ
massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce.
Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow
supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31,
making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through
spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I
supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a
luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an
~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal
close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external
arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence
of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level
recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the
prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or
classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role
of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154
thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar
component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to
forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.

                        Star formation in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $M_* <10^5M_\odot$) is
suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity
distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show
these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been
limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in
such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy
of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing
the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most
populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is
possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main
sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a
bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in
the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more
metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be
explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This
supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum
II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after
reionization.

                        We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500
pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence,
red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au.
A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic
demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are
compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital
inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the
systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass
function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods,
eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a
pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of
1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios
follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are
consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities,
subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a
publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations.
Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple
fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim
0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog
provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.

                        We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density
profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the
notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are
modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically
symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its
surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating
isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear
partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown
fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a
steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of
leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is
$\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the
centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our
dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those
found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our
previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid
element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre
are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or
transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)
or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the
accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,
under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with
$\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the
density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an
attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.

                        Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,
without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster
census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We
create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic
cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster
census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different
spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters
as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's
selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into
Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We
find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,
extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older
clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper
motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection
effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a
Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite
positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher
scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot
be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the
Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at
least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We
predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be
discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be
explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster
destruction rate in the anticentre.

                        Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of
large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and
line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative
model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based
generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark
matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences
of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the
halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo --
conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation,
the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including
the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and
redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations
of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock
LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast
DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can
be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy
lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population.
The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to
develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.

                        We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into
multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO
(3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to
identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have
significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios.
Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas
inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from
non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing
process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast
can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength
of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the
hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous
studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the
gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the
networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main
star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the
hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that
feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic
properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in
our previous studies.

                        Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the
correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to
significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy
dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby
galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical
models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address
this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art
MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR
framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star
formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple
analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point
spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find
that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface
density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and
logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with
indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes
of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and
effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of
the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles,
allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume
density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations
for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for
comparison with multi-wavelength observations.

                        We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24
redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen
lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines
exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample
when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the
presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves
exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the
offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv
values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest
variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust
covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line
ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation
curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and
thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be
accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way
sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated
measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel
constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in
turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering
fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including
the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and
Lyman continuum radiation.

                        The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several
million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical
and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their
associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$
observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming
galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central
region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy
presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and
then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between
the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm
gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of
${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm
log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these
sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is
associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of
star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and
stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the
$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial
scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics
of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The
diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas,
stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although
these relations show relatively large scatter.

                        This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the
local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations.
We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the
local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization
simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict
collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first
all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$,
[NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions
only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry
out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent
metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing
features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very
local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370
$\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the
observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a
factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate
required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas,
possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding
the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their
ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely
ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the
leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of
ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

                        Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect
critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical
foundation model developments. Our project homepage is available at

                        Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in
the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such
substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of
the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a
satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such
structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in
plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is
perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small
scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third
macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We
derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action
variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the
Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle
simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital
scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself
is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently
generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.
