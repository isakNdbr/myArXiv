                        Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test
and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a
Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori
knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the
traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian
hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst
others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions
inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of
extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In
stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are
<10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at
3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian
expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over
the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator
is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This
new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of
the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.

                        As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported
with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and
properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced
by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar
extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,
corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane
characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.
By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic
longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with
the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic
mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at
approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.
Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of
interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material
below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc
above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the
reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of
the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average
extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to
be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of
interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its
implications for the Galactic structure.

                        Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs <50 Myr and <150 pc) are
important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories.
Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is
thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs
with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the
LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry
and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements
the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical
assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or
populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and
most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and
discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the
classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible
with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age
tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified
populations or substructures.

                        Both of gyrochronology and the rotation-activity relationship are standard
techniques to determine the evolution phase.The mismatch in the definition of
the evolutionary phases has so far raised many issues in physics and
mathematics and hampered the understanding of how the internal dynamo processes
affect the observable properties.To address this problem, we seek a unified
scheme that shows a one-to-one mapping from gyrochronology to the
rotation--activity relationship.We obtained the chromospheric activity $R'_{\rm
HK}$ of 6846 stars and their rotation periods to investigate the
rotation--activity relationship.We apply a three-interval model to fit the
relationship and find that it is best fitted by three intervals in the range of
Ro$<0.7$.We associate those intervals to the convective, gap and interface
phases of gyrochronology.Furthermore,we suggest an additional epoch at late
times of the I phase.We further use the three-interval models to fit the
period--activity relationship in temperature bins and determine the duration of
the transition phase as a function of effective temperature.By comparing the
critical temperature and period of the g-to-I transition with the slowly
rotating sequence of 10 young open clusters whose ages range from 1 Myr to 2.5
Gyr, we conclude that our new model finds the pure I sequence without fast
rotating outliers, which defines the zero-age I sequence (ZAIS).We propose that
there is an ambiguous consensus on when the I sequence starts to work.This
ambiguity is from the visually convergent sequence of the color--period
diagrams in open clusters.This visually convergent sequence is younger than the
ZAIS and is actually the pre-I sequence that can be associated with the stall
of the spin-down. Our results unify the rotation--activity relationship and
gyrochonology for the stellar evolution of low-mass stars, for which we coined
the ``CgIW" scenario.

                        Being the most energetic events in the known universe, the impact of galaxy
cluster mergers on the properties of the resident galaxies has yet to be
well-understood. In this paper, we investigate the effects of merging
environments on star formation in nearby clusters ($0.04<z<0.06$) from the SAMI
Galaxy Survey - A168, A2399, A3380, and EDCC 0442 - which exhibit different
dynamical activity. Using single-fiber spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster
Redshift Survey (SAMI-CRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we trace star
formation (SF) activity across the cluster sample by identifying the
star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild
enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction $f_{SFG}$ in merging clusters,
although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space
distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the
passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the
relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm
H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence
of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both
the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near
possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due
to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that
are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had
longer to quench.

                        For more than fifty years, astronomers have mapped the neutral hydrogen gas
in the Galaxy assuming kinematically derived distances. We employ the distances
of nearby young stars, which trace the gas from which they formed, in
longitude-latitude-velocity space to map this gas without using kinematic
distances. We denote this new method "pattern matching". Analysis of simulated
spiral galaxies indicates that our pattern matching distances are 24% more
accurate than kinematic distances for gas within 15 kpc of the Sun. The two
methods provide similar agreement with parallaxes towards these masers,
although the kinematic method shows a small systematic offset in the distance
that is not present in the pattern matching distance. Using parallaxes and
velocities for masers, we show that this novel method, when matched with nearby
Cepheids, performs well compared to kinematics. This analysis is restricted to
sources that have a reasonably good match with a member of our Cepheid sample.
The distances derived here, and the associated map, have broad utility - from
improving our understanding of star formation and the dynamical structure of
the Galaxy, to informing 3-D dust maps.

                        Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular
clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations
from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study
extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface
densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The
results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected
from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii
within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent
interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the
pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and
extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These
findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between
turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular
interstellar medium.

                        MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy,
Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in
archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement
($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log
M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI
reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance
measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within
over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear
signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center
by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this
disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI
size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a
suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI
reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in
which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium
after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in
precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation
episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.

                        High-redshift ($z\sim1$) galaxy clusters are the domain where environmental
quenching mechanisms are expected to emerge as important factors in the
evolution of the quiescent galaxy population. Uncovering these initially subtle
effects requires exploring multiple dependencies of quenching across the
cluster environment, and through time. We analyse the stellar-mass functions
(SMFs) of 17 galaxy clusters within the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys between
$0.8<z<1.5$, and with $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}>9.5$. The data are fit
simultaneously with a Bayesian model that allows the Schechter function
parameters of the quiescent and star-forming populations to vary smoothly with
cluster-centric radius and redshift. The model also fits the radial galaxy
number density profile of each population, allowing the global quenched
fraction to be parameterised as a function of redshift and cluster velocity
dispersion. We find the star-forming SMF to not depend on radius or redshift.
For the quiescent population however, there is $\sim2\sigma$ evidence for a
radial dependence. Outside the cluster core ($R>0.3\,R_{\rm200}$), the quenched
fraction above $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}=9.5$ is $\sim40{\rm\;per\,cent}$, and
the quiescent SMF is similar in shape to the star-forming field. In contrast,
the cluster core has an elevated quenched fraction ($\sim70{\rm\;per\,cent}$),
and a quiescent SMF similar in shape to the quiescent field population. We
explore contributions of 'early mass-quenching' and mass-independent
'environmental-quenching' models in each of these radial regimes. The core is
well-described primarily by early mass-quenching, which we interpret as
accelerated quenching of massive galaxies in protoclusters, possibly through
merger-driven feedback mechanisms. The non-core is better described through
mass-independent, environmental-quenching of the infalling field population.

                        The evolution of low-mass galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and
environmental factors, yet the role of environment and mergers in regulating
their growth and star formation rates remains poorly understood, especially in
the low-density regime. This study aims to compare the evolutionary pathways
and merger histories of star-forming and quenched galaxies in dense (cluster)
and under-dense (void) environments, focusing on galaxies with stellar masses
in the range $10^{8.5} \leq M_\star/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.5}$. It presents the
first statistical analysis within this stellar mass range, explicitly
distinguishing between mini, minor, and major mergers across varying
environments. Using the high-resolution TNG300-1 simulation from the
IllustrisTNG project, we classify galaxies as star-forming and quenched based
on sSFR and UVJ criteria. We track their physical properties over the last
$\sim 11.5$ Gyr ($z < 3$), follow their complete merger histories,
distinguishing between major, minor, and mini mergers, and assess the
statistical impact of these mergers on star formation, gas content, and the
mass assembly of their supermassive black holes.

                        We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way
(MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the Auriga simulations.
We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW
disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find
a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the
emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The
transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated
by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be
caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In
others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with
singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form
too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap
between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar
neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the
circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs
losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger
events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]}
\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in
the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe]
plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is
observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or
declining SFR.

                        Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical
abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a
pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early
universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The
system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of
$\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of
[M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen
abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion
is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide
robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario
proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''
$L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through
systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that
these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star
cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby
affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.
