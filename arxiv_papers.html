                        We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by
cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose
detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early
Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a
dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission
factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the
characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime
around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass
lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing
depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength
$\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical
geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent
ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of
the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers
lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating
pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on
the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS
lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a
wide region of parameter space.

                        SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of
the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the
nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a
bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While
previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we
present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the
12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along
with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also
perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern
tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions,
including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density.
Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are
gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of
active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate
of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material
to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this
work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star
formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically
reshapes the extended tails.

                        In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of
stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios
from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars.
These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field
stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our
empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N])
abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by
combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular
clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as
a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within
the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have
established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that
have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any
extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm
yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This
relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17
sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be
consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and
APO-K2.

                        Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions
remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and
high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot
subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8
\,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet
Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic
Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star
candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this
sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped
stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model
combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV
photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real
Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding,
extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated
stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a
recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous
companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased
toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and
toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show
UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or
improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict
contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars
with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting
higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models
and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.

                        The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to
dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions.
Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation
and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the
gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a
supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid
timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body
simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.
Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic
simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback
from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also
scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or
faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We
find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink
particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a
simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we
would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the
dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities
directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with
(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback
processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the
expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.

                        The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of
the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed
with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case
when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes
into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on
the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were
taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the
standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and
the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about
25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model
decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In
addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of
the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is
impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also
compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the
ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of
interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund
2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the
hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.

                        The pre-main-sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars on the
upper main sequence is still a vast mystery and not well understood. Our
analysis of young associations and open clusters aims to find (very) young CP
stars to try to put a lower boundary on the age of such objects. Using three
catalogues of open clusters and associations, we determined membership
probabilities using HDBSCAN. The hot stars from this selection were submitted
to synthetic $\Delta a$ photometry, spectral, and light curve classification to
determine which ones are CP stars and candidates. Subsequently, we used
spectral energy distribution fitting and emission line analysis to check for
possible PMS CP stars. The results were compared to the literature. We detected
971 CP stars and candidates {in 217 clusters and associations}. A relatively
large fraction, $\sim$10\% of those, show characteristics of PMS CP stars. This
significantly expands the known list of candidate PMS CP stars, bringing us
closer to solving the mystery of their origin.

                        Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides
insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of
large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace
overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test
this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous,
gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55
at $z_\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band
imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space
Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts,
$z_\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for
companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\pm2$ and $15\pm3$ companion
galaxies exist with consistent $z_\text{phot}$ ($dz \leq 0.2$) within a
projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These
correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\delta = 0.1 \pm 0.2$ and ${\delta} =1.0
\pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \pm 0.4)\sigma$ and $(2.2 \pm 0.6)
\sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane,
HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the
overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite
its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of
two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts
of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small
sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster
cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm
the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.

                        We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the
Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail
distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at
$l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO
$J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm
0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses
of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively,
and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of
the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The
temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the
typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or
close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds
are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the
strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds
represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic
plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is
the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the
falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible
implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar
medium are discussed.

                        We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars
on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift
galaxies ($0.02$\,$<$\,z\,$<$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys
DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair
interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of
companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their
host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred
galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more
pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than
unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have
suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual
role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven
enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate
kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when
a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central
starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and
contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting
for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF
regulation in interacting galaxies.

                        We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D
correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR)
known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5<z<7$.
Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we
present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use
to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured
direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$
$\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent
JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies
between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR
slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed
to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III]
flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on
the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic
high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation
where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an
intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity
variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat
intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these
redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in
low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet
to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully
selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight
constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay
between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.
