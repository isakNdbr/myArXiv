                        Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test
and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a
Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori
knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the
traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian
hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst
others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions
inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of
extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In
stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are
<10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at
3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian
expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over
the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator
is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This
new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of
the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.

                        We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB)
stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution
spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the
RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid
contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54.
Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on
the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species
(from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The
sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we
can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by
core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed
[{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex,
compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower
[Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way
stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and
[Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern
of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the
elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower
contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe],
[Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia
(e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture
elements ([Eu/Fe]).

                        As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported
with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and
properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced
by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar
extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,
corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane
characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.
By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic
longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with
the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic
mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at
approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.
Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of
interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material
below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc
above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the
reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of
the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average
extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to
be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of
interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its
implications for the Galactic structure.

                        Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs <50 Myr and <150 pc) are
important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories.
Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is
thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs
with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the
LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry
and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements
the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical
assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or
populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and
most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and
discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the
classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible
with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age
tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified
populations or substructures.

                        Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p
(the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the
Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a
lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission
lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data),
the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to
(-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5
sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the
recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher
frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for
SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).

                        We present the result of near-infrared spectroscopy using Keck/MOSFIRE for 23
member galaxies in an X-ray cluster XCS2215 ($z=1.46$) to investigate the
environmental dependence of gaseous flows and metallicities. We find that the
metallicities derived from H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines of the cluster
galaxies are enhanced by 0.08-0.15 dex with $\sim$2 $\sigma$ significance
compared to field counterparts for the same stellar mass. It suggests that
inefficient gas accretion in the shock-heated intracluster medium (ICM) in the
cluster core results in the lack of metallicity dilution. We also estimate the
mass-loading factor by comparing the observed galaxies with the chemical
evolution model that takes into account the outflow processes on the
metallicity versus gas mass fraction diagram constructed together with the ALMA
data. We find that the outflows from galaxies in the cluster core region tend
to be weaker than those of galaxies in the general field. It is likely due to
the confinement of gas by the high pressure of the surrounding ICM in the
cluster core, which leads to the recycling of the outflowing gas that comes
back to the system and is used for further star formation, resulting in the
progression of chemical evolution. Compared with higher redshift protocluster
galaxies at $z>2$, which tend to show lower metallicity than the field galaxies
due probably to dilution of metals by pristine gas inflow, we are seeing the
transition of gas accretion mode from efficient cold stream mode to the
inefficient hot mode.

                        Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor)
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding
molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in
projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts
the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the
properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why
these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama
Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of
continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers
CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the
nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical
properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared
the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC.
Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and
HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust
lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun,
and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses
obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of
the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas.
Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers
($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young
stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are
consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the
densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

                        Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at $z > 6$) suffers from degeneracies among the
apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These
degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1)
spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to
break these degeneracies with a sample of $N = 22$ high-redshift star-forming
galaxies at $7 < z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 9$, using some of the deepest existing
imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the
imaging from JWST/MIRI at $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$, which provides coverage of the
rest-frame $I$-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population
properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star
formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices.
Evaluating these quantities both with and without the $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ data
point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more
filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the
rest-frame $I$-band coverage for the vast majority ($\approx 80\%$) of our
sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined
by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest
offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within
extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust
characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for
high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at $z
\approx 8$.

                        The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and
spectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of
astrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly
used stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified
form of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates
for photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All
clusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on
their ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model
spectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally
test four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for
individual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce
significant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce
scatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction.
Extinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in
age, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that
because of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of
individual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be
meaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction
curve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting
results when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of
cluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user
choice of SPS code and extinction curve.

                        We present high-frequency (18-24 GHz) radio continuum observations towards
335 methanol masers, excellent signposts for young, embedded high-mass
protostars. These complete the search for hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions
towards young high-mass star-forming clumps within the fourth quadrant of the
Galactic plane. HCHII regions are the earliest observable signatures of radio
continuum emission from high-mass stars ionizing their surroundings, though
their rarity and short lifetimes make them challenging to study. We have
observed methanol maser sites at 20-arcsec resolution and identified 121
discrete high-frequency radio sources. Of these, 42 compact sources are
embedded in dense clumps and coincide with methanol masers, making them as
excellent HCHII region candidates. These sources were followed up at higher
resolution (0.5-arcsec) for confirmation. We constructed spectral energy
distributions across 5-24 GHz to determine their physical properties, fitting
either a simple HII region model or a power-law as needed. This analysis
identified 20 HCHII regions, 9 intermediate objects, 3 UCHII regions, and 3
radio jet candidates. Combining these results with previous findings, the
SCOTCH survey has identified 33 HCHII regions, 15 intermediate objects, 9 UCHII
regions, and 4 radio jet candidates, tripling the known number of HCHII
regions. Eleven of these sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz. This survey
provides a valuable sample of the youngest HII regions and insights into early
massive star formation.

                        Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$
halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC)
region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$,
which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further
examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the
7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3
parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO
and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the
+50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is
partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our
knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be
located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at
the GC region.

                        We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive
($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the
JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved
kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our
measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line
spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source
morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are
orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10
galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 =
180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter.
The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain
their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample
indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early
massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with
other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between
rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more
rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and
likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support
compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our
kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These
dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median
$M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in
the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a
scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs,
gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due
to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

                        Being the most energetic events in the known universe, the impact of galaxy
cluster mergers on the properties of the resident galaxies has yet to be
well-understood. In this paper, we investigate the effects of merging
environments on star formation in nearby clusters ($0.04<z<0.06$) from the SAMI
Galaxy Survey - A168, A2399, A3380, and EDCC 0442 - which exhibit different
dynamical activity. Using single-fiber spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster
Redshift Survey (SAMI-CRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we trace star
formation (SF) activity across the cluster sample by identifying the
star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild
enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction $f_{SFG}$ in merging clusters,
although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space
distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the
passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the
relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm
H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence
of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both
the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near
possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due
to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that
are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had
longer to quench.
