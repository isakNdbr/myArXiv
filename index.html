                        The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass
star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro
objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of
the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the
westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a
complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra
field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique
X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray
properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR
photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of
young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray
sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The
known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not.
Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source
are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the
nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains
speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder
for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma
dark cloud.

                        We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with
supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud
($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact
with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr
Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and
a radius 0.24{\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the
adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular
clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was
revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found
located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at
$-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the
position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests
that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the
stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The
giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated
SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI
absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the
radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the
evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission
reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between
the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large
molecular clump.

                        The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to
curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member
stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM
survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has
established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to
constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster
sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other
large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate
considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial
[Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's
current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$
dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not
find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element
gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have
sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In
this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial
abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.

                        We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a
blue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67.
We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of
$0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$ and a cooling age of $\sim400$ Myr. This
requires a WD progenitor of $\sim3$ M$_\odot$, significantly larger than the
current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor
star formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the
turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a
hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a
tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended
from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL.
The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD
progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days
requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL
indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind
prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common
envelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD
binary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\odot$ Helium WD,
making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a
sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.

                        The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star
formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster
members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant
uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young
Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 <
l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation
in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on
2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm
to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte
Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO
astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the
Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust
membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in
higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In
this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters
with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new
members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars
in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership
probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more
accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within
uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data,
and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

                        Galaxy clusters produce a very hostile environment to galaxies, whose gas
gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching
of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through
galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the
physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a
filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is
the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas
stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are
ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster
environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar
and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with
age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst.
The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of
H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of
which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a
simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling
the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics.
The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and
loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated
dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star
formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude
that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium,
present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure
stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still
enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.

                        Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body
calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex,
multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions
representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern
simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy
formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and
feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This
review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations,
outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and
evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the
post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these
numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and
accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution
boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the
robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding
of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.

                        Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to
become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial
element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear
rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts,
remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the
Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy
morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the
nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed
rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust
lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple
armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope
images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings
are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+
rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand
design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with
later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In
addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear
spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the
nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host
galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a
fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the
nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg
structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very
weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate
cases.

                        Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between
fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation,
self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these
processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10
Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at
100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI
emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes
using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on
studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of
these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for
the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer.
We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by
Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong
criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and
derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$
and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94
Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to
study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and
kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how
stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic
gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then
unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.
