                        We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the
star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and
NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data.
Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type
star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and
HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of
3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at
Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas
traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing
the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions.
From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of
N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron
temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The
analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the
HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a
potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front
advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that
IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback
actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early
evolution of compact HII regions.

                        Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection
of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative
method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside
integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully
explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone
fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains
two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction
($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor
studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2):
$\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2}
= 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with
VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions
associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation.
Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher
than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture
of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions
reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a
spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas
and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can
begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations.
Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a
growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type
Ib SNe progenitors.

                        Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation
history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can
provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of
K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra}
observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar,
Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the
Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all
probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature,
non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit,
taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds,
which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or
carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar
abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances,
which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in
Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star
winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal
mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as
expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on
the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the
Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow
onto Sgr A*, are addressed.

                        We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that
contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei
open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to
measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained
interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky
positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond
orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084
M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the
cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr
(MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate
escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the
massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied
progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are
made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.

                        We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO)
variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the
M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT
Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data
from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164
bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450
and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified
in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an
intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT
monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the
source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic
variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability
occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional
variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has
previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the
intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less
variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that
this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to
M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase
the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex
variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the
importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming
environments.

                        Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made
available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2
{\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating
far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases,
with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages
characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the
resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate
features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering
hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges
as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and
investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component
traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on
the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a
multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate
set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based
on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists
between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission,
and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our
designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related
to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without
considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our
machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature
engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings
suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary
phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature
of the SF process.

                        Both of gyrochronology and the rotation-activity relationship are standard
techniques to determine the evolution phase.The mismatch in the definition of
the evolutionary phases has so far raised many issues in physics and
mathematics and hampered the understanding of how the internal dynamo processes
affect the observable properties.To address this problem, we seek a unified
scheme that shows a one-to-one mapping from gyrochronology to the
rotation--activity relationship.We obtained the chromospheric activity $R'_{\rm
HK}$ of 6846 stars and their rotation periods to investigate the
rotation--activity relationship.We apply a three-interval model to fit the
relationship and find that it is best fitted by three intervals in the range of
Ro$<0.7$.We associate those intervals to the convective, gap and interface
phases of gyrochronology.Furthermore,we suggest an additional epoch at late
times of the I phase.We further use the three-interval models to fit the
period--activity relationship in temperature bins and determine the duration of
the transition phase as a function of effective temperature.By comparing the
critical temperature and period of the g-to-I transition with the slowly
rotating sequence of 10 young open clusters whose ages range from 1 Myr to 2.5
Gyr, we conclude that our new model finds the pure I sequence without fast
rotating outliers, which defines the zero-age I sequence (ZAIS).We propose that
there is an ambiguous consensus on when the I sequence starts to work.This
ambiguity is from the visually convergent sequence of the color--period
diagrams in open clusters.This visually convergent sequence is younger than the
ZAIS and is actually the pre-I sequence that can be associated with the stall
of the spin-down. Our results unify the rotation--activity relationship and
gyrochonology for the stellar evolution of low-mass stars, for which we coined
the ``CgIW" scenario.

                        Context. Be stars are rapidly rotating stars surrounded by a disc; however,
the origin of these remains unclear. Mass and angular momentum transfer in
close binaries account for the rapid rotation of a major fraction of Be stars,
supported by the previous detection of low-mass stripped companions to them.
The stripped companions can be helium burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs),
and white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. The main objective of this study is to
characterise the identified Be stars in the young open cluster NGC 663, and
search for possible hot companions. Methods. We present the first ultraviolet
(UV) photometric study of NGC 663 using far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) data
from UVIT/AstroSat as a part of the UOCS series (XVIII). We identified 23
previously known Be stars in the cluster. Further, we utilised the spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting technique to derive the fundamental
parameters and to search for UV-bright companions of the identified Be stars.
Results. Our study reveals that 19 out of 23 Be stars show a significant UV
excess, indicating the presence of hot companions. Here, we report the first
detection of high-mass sdOB companions to Be stars, with 69.5% of them found in
binaries within a cluster, offering direct evidence of binary interactions.
Conclusions. This study showcases the key role of binary interactions in the
formation of Be stars in clusters and provides insights into massive star
evolution.

                        For more than fifty years, astronomers have mapped the neutral hydrogen gas
in the Galaxy assuming kinematically derived distances. We employ the distances
of nearby young stars, which trace the gas from which they formed, in
longitude-latitude-velocity space to map this gas without using kinematic
distances. We denote this new method "pattern matching". Analysis of simulated
spiral galaxies indicates that our pattern matching distances are 24% more
accurate than kinematic distances for gas within 15 kpc of the Sun. The two
methods provide similar agreement with parallaxes towards these masers,
although the kinematic method shows a small systematic offset in the distance
that is not present in the pattern matching distance. Using parallaxes and
velocities for masers, we show that this novel method, when matched with nearby
Cepheids, performs well compared to kinematics. This analysis is restricted to
sources that have a reasonably good match with a member of our Cepheid sample.
The distances derived here, and the associated map, have broad utility - from
improving our understanding of star formation and the dynamical structure of
the Galaxy, to informing 3-D dust maps.

                        Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular
clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations
from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study
extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface
densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The
results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected
from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii
within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent
interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the
pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and
extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These
findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between
turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular
interstellar medium.

                        MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy,
Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in
archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement
($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log
M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI
reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance
measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within
over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear
signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center
by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this
disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI
size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a
suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI
reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in
which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium
after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in
precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation
episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.

                        High-redshift ($z\sim1$) galaxy clusters are the domain where environmental
quenching mechanisms are expected to emerge as important factors in the
evolution of the quiescent galaxy population. Uncovering these initially subtle
effects requires exploring multiple dependencies of quenching across the
cluster environment, and through time. We analyse the stellar-mass functions
(SMFs) of 17 galaxy clusters within the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys between
$0.8<z<1.5$, and with $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}>9.5$. The data are fit
simultaneously with a Bayesian model that allows the Schechter function
parameters of the quiescent and star-forming populations to vary smoothly with
cluster-centric radius and redshift. The model also fits the radial galaxy
number density profile of each population, allowing the global quenched
fraction to be parameterised as a function of redshift and cluster velocity
dispersion. We find the star-forming SMF to not depend on radius or redshift.
For the quiescent population however, there is $\sim2\sigma$ evidence for a
radial dependence. Outside the cluster core ($R>0.3\,R_{\rm200}$), the quenched
fraction above $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}=9.5$ is $\sim40{\rm\;per\,cent}$, and
the quiescent SMF is similar in shape to the star-forming field. In contrast,
the cluster core has an elevated quenched fraction ($\sim70{\rm\;per\,cent}$),
and a quiescent SMF similar in shape to the quiescent field population. We
explore contributions of 'early mass-quenching' and mass-independent
'environmental-quenching' models in each of these radial regimes. The core is
well-described primarily by early mass-quenching, which we interpret as
accelerated quenching of massive galaxies in protoclusters, possibly through
merger-driven feedback mechanisms. The non-core is better described through
mass-independent, environmental-quenching of the infalling field population.

                        The evolution of low-mass galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and
environmental factors, yet the role of environment and mergers in regulating
their growth and star formation rates remains poorly understood, especially in
the low-density regime. This study aims to compare the evolutionary pathways
and merger histories of star-forming and quenched galaxies in dense (cluster)
and under-dense (void) environments, focusing on galaxies with stellar masses
in the range $10^{8.5} \leq M_\star/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.5}$. It presents the
first statistical analysis within this stellar mass range, explicitly
distinguishing between mini, minor, and major mergers across varying
environments. Using the high-resolution TNG300-1 simulation from the
IllustrisTNG project, we classify galaxies as star-forming and quenched based
on sSFR and UVJ criteria. We track their physical properties over the last
$\sim 11.5$ Gyr ($z < 3$), follow their complete merger histories,
distinguishing between major, minor, and mini mergers, and assess the
statistical impact of these mergers on star formation, gas content, and the
mass assembly of their supermassive black holes.

                        We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way
(MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the Auriga simulations.
We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW
disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find
a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the
emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The
transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated
by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be
caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In
others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with
singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form
too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap
between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar
neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the
circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs
losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger
events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]}
\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in
the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe]
plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is
observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or
declining SFR.

                        Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical
abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a
pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early
universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The
system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of
$\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of
[M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen
abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion
is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide
robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario
proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''
$L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through
systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that
these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star
cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby
affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.

                        The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an
irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star
formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars
in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging
Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as
surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these
structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular
morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the
projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The
2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and
the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These
values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In
addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows
a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of
the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical
star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.

                        We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of
dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse
prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We
introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain
assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning
process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in
real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First,
from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves
interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over
conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from
the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals
improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and
different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into
diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and
provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data
statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can
align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.
