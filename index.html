                        We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the
open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity,
\textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main
sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a
positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO
stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS
while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening
effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close
binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the
tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking
hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial
distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the
cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that
tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation
rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during
the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the
rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.

                        Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from
high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can
effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims
to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately
one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity.
The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence
and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population
Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open
clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and
reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and
homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the
equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral
synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti),
light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the
existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe]
versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns
predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are
present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a
negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and
reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical
evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for
upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and
WEAVE.

                        Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down
to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures,
called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are
connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the
connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales
towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I
protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM
30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in
the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are
associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN,
while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the
former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope
scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses
and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6
Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope
mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low
compared to the envelope mass (<1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of
the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of
mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The
rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the
large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three
disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this
surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However,
we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could
be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.

                        Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and
majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of
dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context,
we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} >
10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961
non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$
M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a
previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with
merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates
(SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the
median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and
redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and
suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement.
The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in
post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found
to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer
regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts.
This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the
merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given
small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific
SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers
are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime,
where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests
that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more
comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their
evolution.

                        Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our
understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight
into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the
largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of
seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local
$5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures
show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known
star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,
primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are
precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show
an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the
Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary
by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only.
This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal
structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These
findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic
structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and
likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.

                        In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux
concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA
data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm
H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm
H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$
flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find
that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted
stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental
effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation
main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we
find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have
higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass
regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently
occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of
prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy
structure formation are discussed.

                        The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex
and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across
its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical
evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from
an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and
most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation
(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex
in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major
merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in
the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have
experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our
previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of
wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned
merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the
clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge
formations.
  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample
that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the
expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show
a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models
that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with
the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we
suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,
which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic
chemical enrichment over time.

                        Star-forming galaxies on the main sequence (MS) are often regarded as a
uniform population characterized by similar global star formation properties.
However, there exists a diversity in galaxy morphologies at fixed stellar mass
and SFR. In this study, using spatially-resolved properties from the MaNGA
final data release, we classify MS galaxies into late-type (MS-late) and
early-type (MS-early). In addition, we further divide the MS-early galaxies
into two distinct subgroups based on their internal star formation and stellar
mass distributions within the galaxies. The first group -- ``MS-early\_SF'' --
shows centrally concentrated star formation without prominent stellar bulges
and resides preferentially in dense environments, suggesting
environmentally-driven evolution. The second group -- ``MS-early\_stellar'' --
exhibits significant stellar bulges with suppressed central star formation,
maintains disk-like star formation patterns, and inhabits environments similar
to those of late-type galaxies, indicating evolution through internal secular
processes. Our findings demonstrate that spatially-resolved observations play
critical roles in revealing the diverse evolutionary pathways hidden within
galaxies that share similar global properties.

                        Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to
understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic
time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold
gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and
efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular
gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich
systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent
galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly
weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical
correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust
deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we
calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other
observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from
the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in
quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly
unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As
a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this
population than previously thought.

                        Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host
lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints
have been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs
can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching
and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at
different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate
redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs
retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar
mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs.
Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36,
targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection
criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also
perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent
sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy
properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty
galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower
than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs
by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on
the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than
spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions
hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately
30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content
is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment
processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to
yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.
