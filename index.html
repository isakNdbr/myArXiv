                        We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the
star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and
NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data.
Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type
star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and
HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of
3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at
Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas
traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing
the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions.
From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of
N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron
temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The
analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the
HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a
potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front
advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that
IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback
actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early
evolution of compact HII regions.

                        Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection
of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative
method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside
integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully
explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone
fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains
two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction
($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor
studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2):
$\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2}
= 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with
VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions
associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation.
Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher
than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture
of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions
reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a
spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas
and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can
begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations.
Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a
growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type
Ib SNe progenitors.

                        Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation
history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can
provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of
K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra}
observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar,
Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the
Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all
probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature,
non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit,
taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds,
which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or
carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar
abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances,
which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in
Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star
winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal
mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as
expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on
the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the
Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow
onto Sgr A*, are addressed.

                        We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that
contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei
open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to
measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained
interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky
positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond
orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084
M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the
cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr
(MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate
escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the
massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied
progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are
made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.

                        We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO)
variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the
M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT
Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data
from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164
bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450
and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified
in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an
intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT
monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the
source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic
variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability
occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional
variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has
previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the
intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less
variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that
this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to
M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase
the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex
variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the
importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming
environments.

                        Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made
available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2
{\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating
far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases,
with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages
characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the
resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate
features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering
hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges
as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and
investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component
traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on
the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a
multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate
set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based
on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists
between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission,
and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our
designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related
to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without
considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our
machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature
engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings
suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary
phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature
of the SF process.

                        Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be
determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we
investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously
unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric
distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We
obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field
unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting
red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial
velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six
elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated
estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-
0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7
kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-
0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and
indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance
ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both
clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-
0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for
Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high
resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of
the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.

                        We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way
(MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the Auriga simulations.
We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW
disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find
a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the
emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The
transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated
by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be
caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In
others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with
singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form
too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap
between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar
neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the
circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs
losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger
events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]}
\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in
the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe]
plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is
observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or
declining SFR.

                        Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical
abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a
pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early
universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The
system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of
$\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of
[M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen
abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion
is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide
robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario
proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''
$L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through
systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that
these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star
cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby
affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.

                        The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an
irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star
formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars
in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging
Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as
surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these
structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular
morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the
projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The
2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and
the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These
values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In
addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows
a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of
the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical
star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.

                        CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) are commonly used as bulk molecular gas tracers. The CO
line ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among
galaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements
constructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative
calibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio
variations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is
challenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14
nearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset
includes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$
variation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale
environmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR)
surface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is
0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex
variation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in
single-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean
value of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards
galactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various
galactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law
slope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our
findings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples,
assuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular
gas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux
calibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic
scatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.

                        The Milky Way is home to a thin disk that can be defined via kinematics
and/or elemental abundances. The elemental abundance-defined thin disk, also
called the low-alpha disk, is generally thought to be comprised of stars on
planar, circular orbits that approximate the circular velocity curve. While
this is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like
abundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we
identify and investigate $\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and
very slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could
be kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the
halo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that
could alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow
or retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess
whether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's
reported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each
star, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars
is dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that
could produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars
that could be connected to these mechanisms. With this sample we investigate
rare processes, such as binary disruption by the central supermassive black
hole, while also providing a unique perspective into the chemo-dynamics and
structural components of the Milky Way.

                        Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the
interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1
and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes
of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative
spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\mu$m) and H$\alpha$ emission at
various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in
galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation
is detected in H$\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the
stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\alpha$ emission. This
significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,
illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR
time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.
Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,
radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two
time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,
they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is
likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with
near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is
longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured
backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM
surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This
suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.
