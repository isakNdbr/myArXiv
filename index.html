                        Using high-precision observations from the space-based \textit{Gaia} and
\textit{TESS} missions, complemented by ground-based spectroscopic data and
multi-band photometric surveys, we perform a detailed investigation of the
Galactic open cluster NGC~2506. We present a new analysis of the
intermediate-age open cluster NGC~2506, using joint fits to the radial
velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five double-lined
binary systems, including two eclipsing binaries. The analysis yields
self-consistent estimates of the cluster's age, distance, and extinction, based
on 18 free parameters: 10 stellar masses, 5 orbital inclinations, and common
values for age, distance, and $A_V$. The SED fitting incorporates stellar
isochrones, and the resulting parameters are examined through HR diagrams
(R--$T_{\rm eff}$, R--M, and M--$T_{\rm eff}$) to assess evolutionary
consistency. The age we derive for the cluster is $1.94 \pm 0.03$ Gyr for an
assumed [Fe/H] = -0.30, and a fitting formula is given for extrapolation to
other metallicities. The distance we find from the SED fitting is $3189 \pm 53$
pc, and this is to be compared with our own inference from the Gaia data which
is $3105 \pm 75$ pc, based on 919 stars identified as cluster members. Our
results demonstrate the power of binary systems in tightly constraining
cluster-wide age and distance at this evolutionary stage. This approach
represents one of the most accurate characterizations of an intermediate-age
open cluster using multiple binary systems.

                        Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution
of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a
multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located
at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars
in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared
data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar
objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age,
mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength
suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded
YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in
this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope
(DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting,
most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with
the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative
proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative
of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the
Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas
in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple
analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage,
and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in
the BRC region due to radiative feedback.

                        Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and
thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at
Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux
(GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and
reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random
sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution
code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar
models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between
$0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their
final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy
distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear)
processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller
(larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$,
located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the
GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from
Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can
reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova
neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F,
challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of
solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the
solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick
off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe
to discover New Physics.

                        Classical Cepheids (CCs) in Galactic open clusters (OCs) provide essential
observational constraints for calibrating the period-age relation (PAR) and the
period-Wesenheit relation (PWR) of CCs. However, distant and long-period OC
Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise
determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In
this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an
extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining
astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs
associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC
Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected
associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the
41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters
derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age
= (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to
WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the
sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period
confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly
discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the
PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated
parallaxes, respectively.

                        We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end
of the H$\beta$+[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down
to $10^{39}$ erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell
S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring
combined H$\beta$+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The
resulting LF ($\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\alpha<-2$),
indicating a lower number density of low H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV.
We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the
H$\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H$\beta$, or
(iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H$\beta$
ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]$\lambda$5008 LF ($\alpha$=-1.45 to -1.66) and
a steeper H$\beta$ LF ($\alpha$=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing
metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H$\beta$+[OIII]
LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we
find that galaxies with H$\alpha$ flux $>10^{39}$ erg/s
(SFR(H$\alpha$)$>5\times10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of
the ionising photon budget at 7<z<8 and 8<z<9, respectively (for
$f_{esc}=0.1$). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to
the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density
(CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low
SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the
ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE
has detected the bulk of the total H$\beta$+[OIII] emission from star-forming
galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.

                        We present radial profiles of surface brightness in UV and IR bands, estimate
stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) and star formation rate surface
density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), and predict the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor
($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) for over 5,000 local galaxies with stellar mass
$M_\star\,{\geq}\,10^{9.3}\rm\,M_\odot$. We build these profiles and measure
galaxy half-light radii using GALEX and WISE images from the $z$0MGS program,
with special care given to highly inclined galaxies. From the UV and IR surface
brightness profiles, we estimate $\Sigma_\star$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and
use them to predict $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ with state-of-the-art empirical
prescriptions. We validate our (kpc-scale) $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ predictions
against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for
CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark
correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity
and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively
star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated
$\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio
as a function of $M_\star$. A large compilation of literature data suggests
that star-forming galaxies with $M_\star = 10^{9.5{-}11}\,M_\odot$ show strong
anti-correlations of SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(1{-}0)} \propto M_\star^{-0.29}$
and SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(2{-}1)} \propto M_\star^{-0.40}$. The estimated
$\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ trends, when combined with a constant molecular gas
depletion time $t_\mathrm{dep}$, can only explain ${\approx}1/3$ of these
SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ trends. This suggests that $t_\mathrm{dep}$ being
systematically shorter in lower-mass star-forming galaxies is the main cause of
the observed SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ variations. (Abridged)

                        Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows
carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these
radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five
different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$,
of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models
predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer
disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because
radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it
elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the
inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational
constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity
($\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations
($\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows
cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our
models reproduce this result at $R\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is
relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\approx-1$ km/s. In
agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower
metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models.
Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative
rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that
establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic
formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this
connection.

                        The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of
galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their
accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\mathrm{occ}$ is
nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \gtrsim
10^{10}~M_\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in
less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on
$f_\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606
galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain
$f_\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function,
$p(\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as
$\lambda=L_\mathrm{X}/M_\star$, and $L_\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion
luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\lambda)$ peaks
around $10^{28}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\odot^{-1}$; above this value,
$p(\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\lambda$, following a power-law that
smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active
galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases
dramatically with decreasing $M_\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\star \approx
10^{11-12}M_\odot$), the occupation fraction is $>93\%$ (a $2\sigma$ lower
limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\%$ ($1\sigma$ errors) between
$M_\star\approx10^{9-10}M_\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\%$ in the dwarf galaxy
regime between $M_\star\approx10^{8-9}~M_\odot$. Our results have significant
implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range
most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and
MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.

                        Understanding how galaxies assemble their mass during the first billion years
of cosmic time is a central goal of extragalactic astrophysics, yet joint
constraints on their sizes and kinematics remain scarce. We present one of the
first statistical studies of the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ size-mass relation at high
redshift with a sample of 213 galaxies at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\approx
4-6$ from the FRESCO and CONGRESS NIRCam grism surveys. We measure the
$\mathrm{H}\alpha$ morphology and kinematics of our sample using the novel
forward modelling Bayesian inference tool $\texttt{geko}$, and complement them
with stellar continuum sizes in the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and optical, obtained
from modelling of imaging data from the JADES survey with $\texttt{Pysersic}$.
At $z\approx5$, we find that the average H$\alpha$ sizes are larger than the
stellar continuum (FUV, NUV and optical), with $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}= 1.17 \pm
0.05$ kpc and $r_{\rm e,cont} \approx 0.9$ kpc for galaxies with
$\log(M_{\star} ~\rm [M_{\odot}])= 9.5$. However, we find no significant
differences between the stellar continuum sizes at different wavelengths,
suggesting that galaxies are not yet steadily growing inside-out at these
epochs. Instead, we find that the ratio $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}/r_{\rm e, NUV}$
increases with the distance above the star-forming main sequence ($\Delta \rm
MS$), consistent with an expansion of H$\alpha$ sizes during episodes of
enhanced star formation caused by an increase in ionising photons. As galaxies
move above the star-forming main sequence, we find an increase of their
rotational support $v/\sigma$, which could be tracing accreting gas illuminated
by the \Ha\ emission. Finally, we find that about half of the elongated systems
($b/a < 0.5$) are not rotationally supported, indicating a potential
flattened/prolate galaxy population at high redshift.

                        Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with
a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer
break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are
believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas,
leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining
the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$,
and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring
Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We
decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components.
Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all
objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by
more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust
attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$.
Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae,
associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases
can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140,
shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and
$H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case
B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to
increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density
(log$n_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does
hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured
($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the
extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general
ISM of the host galaxy.

                        H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful
tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive
stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its
high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique
access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial
morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the
Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas
temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study
of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the
PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction
throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to
the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in
different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the
observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight
decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the
OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho
rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and
preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the
OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P >
6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We
highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the
intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead
nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the
PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase
induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.

                        We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of
simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium
chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at
Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well
below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular
hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the
$10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting
new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the
Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm
erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star
formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at
$z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in
mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical
enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes
undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming
stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough,
they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be
observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at
a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop.
III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} < -17$.
Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that
$75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue,
while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including
satellite halos.

                        Molecular clouds are active sites of star formation in galaxies, and their
formation and evolution are largely affected by stellar feedback. This includes
outflows and winds from newly formed stars, radiation from young clusters, and
supernova explosions. High-resolution molecular line observations allow for the
identification of individual star-forming regions and the study of their
integrated properties. Moreover, simulations are now capable of accurately
replicating the evolution of MCs including all key stellar feedback processes.
We present 13CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the STARFORGE simulations
produced using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, matching the observational
setup of the SEDIGISM survey. From these, we identified the population of MCs
using hierarchical clustering and analysed them to provide insights into the
interpretation of observed MCs as they evolve. The flux distributions of the
post-processed synthetic observations and the properties of the MCs, namely
radius, mass, velocity dispersion, virial parameter and surface density, are
consistent with those of SEDIGISM. Both samples of MCs occupy the same regions
in the scaling relation plots; however, the average distributions of MCs at
different evolutionary stages do not overlap on the plots. This highlights the
reliability of our approach in modelling SEDIGISM and suggests that MCs at
different evolutionary stages contribute to the scatter in observed scaling
relations. We study the trends in MC properties over time to analyse their
physical structure as they evolve. MCs appear as small, diffuse cloudlets in
early stages, followed by their evolution to filamentary structures, before
being shaped by stellar feedback into 3D bubbles and getting dispersed. These
trends in the observable properties of MCs provide strong evidence that clouds
exhibit distinct morphologies over the course of their evolution.

                        We investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy properties at
$z\sim2.5$ using the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which provides
high-resolution three-dimensional maps of intergalactic medium (IGM)
overdensity via Ly$\alpha$ forest tomography. Our analysis focuses on a
UV-selected spectroscopic sample of 2185 galaxies from LATIS and a
complementary set of 1157 galaxies from heterogeneous spectroscopic surveys in
the COSMOS field. We compare these datasets to forward-modeled mock catalogs
constructed from the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation, incorporating realistic
selection functions to match both LATIS and the literature sample. While the
mass-complete simulation predicts strong environmental trends--more massive and
quiescent galaxies preferentially occupy overdense regions--we find that such
trends are significantly weaker or absent in the observed samples. The LATIS
galaxies show no measurable correlation between specific star formation rate
(sSFR) and IGM overdensity, a result reproduced by LATIS-like mock catalogs,
confirming that UV selection systematically excludes passive and dusty galaxies
in dense environments. The literature compilation, despite improved high-mass
coverage, remains incomplete and affected by similar biases. We also analyze a
mass-complete photometric sample from the COSMOS-Web catalog at $z\sim2.5$ and
find no detectable sSFR-environment relation, a null result that our
simulations indicate can be explained by photometric redshift uncertainties. In
particular, we find no evidence for a reversal of the sSFR-density relation at
cosmic noon. These results demonstrate that observed correlations can be
heavily shaped by selection effects, and caution against inferring physical
trends from incomplete spectroscopic samples. Deeper, more representative
spectroscopic surveys are needed to robustly characterize environmental effects
at this epoch.

                        We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES
survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection
of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05)
to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses,
star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the
highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2
M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk,
consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass
of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of
log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems
detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit
broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with
both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the
galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the
redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of
obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but
the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with
samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular
gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples.
We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great
to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult
below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual
galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to
the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential
impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.
