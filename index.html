                        [Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for
$\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$ in six
extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting
their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent
manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust
candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the
observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional
forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the
solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from
interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data
from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which
we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent
and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold".
According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)
\geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least
150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have
been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent
systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass
objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by
rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy
formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent
candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early
passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models:
tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time
passed since quenching as a function of mass.

                        We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web
application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies,
performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain
host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test
FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are
spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for
9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star
formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between
spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we
determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to
misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We
further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample
also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the
spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are
redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between
spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily
trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on
$M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and
Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the
difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that
SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments
for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and
FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast
version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.

                        The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of
material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially
have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows.
High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the
details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited
H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within
the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection
to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral
maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out
of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}]
emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from
S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on
Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and
$\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high
pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at
low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the
observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high
column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock
reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination
of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long
as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is
likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions
of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

                        We present an investigation into the quenching of simulated galaxies across
cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental
mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first
wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work
provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We
investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass
satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and
EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to
separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the
best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest
classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest
classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of
quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching
of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs.
Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched
fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is
strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in
EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations
rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence
of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of
MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is
needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching
processes.

                        X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven
winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the
intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will
be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a
warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such
systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and
provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star
formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for
a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the
photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D
ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra
for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect
of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would
require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a
bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected
noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the
21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star
formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems
clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the
surrounding gas.

                        The central regions of disc galaxies host a rich variety of stellar
structures: nuclear discs, bars, bulges, and boxy-peanut (BP) bulges. These
components are often difficult to disentangle, both photometrically and
kinematically, particularly in star-forming galaxies where dust obscuration and
complex stellar motions complicate interpretation. In this work, we use data
from the GECKOS-MUSE survey to investigate the impact of dust on axisymmetric
Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) models, and assess their
ability to recover kinematic structure in edge-on disc galaxies. We construct
JAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \gtrapprox 85^\circ$) galaxies
that span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic
complexity. We find that when dust is appropriately masked, the disc regions of
each galaxy are fit to $\chi^2_{\text{reduced}}\leq 5$. We analyse
two-dimensional residual velocity fields to identify signatures of
non-axisymmetric structure. We find that derived dynamical masses are constant
within 10% for each galaxy across all dust masking levels. In NGC 3957, a
barred boxy galaxy in our sample, we identify velocity residuals that persist
even under aggressive dust masking, aligned with bar orbits and supported by
photometric bar signatures. We extend this analysis to reveal a bar in IC 1711
and a possible side-on bar in NGC 0522. Our results highlight both the
capabilities and limitations of JAM in dusty, edge-on systems and attempt to
link residual velocities to known non-axisymmetric kinematic structure.

                        The typical galaxy in the local universe is expected to be in a
self-regulated quasi-equilibrium, displaying a settled morphology that falls
within the Hubble Sequence. The Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs are filled with
striking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful
targets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived,
episodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies' evolution. In this paper, we
greatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies
drawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images
and point-source photometry for 216 systems, whose sizes are well-matched to
the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of
the sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images
display rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions,
stellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional
chance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting
highly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond
this atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more
detailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and
spectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of
obvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and
interacting galaxies, resolved stellar populations at the extremes of stellar
density, the properties of young massive stars and stellar clusters, the
physics of the cold ISM and dust, and stellar and gas dynamics.

                        We propose a new amorphous dust emission model based on the soft-potential
(SP) model, applicable in the long-wavelength range from the far-infrared to
the microwave. The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain
amorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS)
model, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP
model, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a
double-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric
interaction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of
the amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical
solutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these
results, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential
barrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed
spectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the
conventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain
various long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening
in the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to
the TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and
laboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model.
