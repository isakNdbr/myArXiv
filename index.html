                        We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study
the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence
of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of
members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1
kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM
method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and
extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These
clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc,
covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters,
stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a
signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and
A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi
Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the
existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of
dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is
found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.

                        We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble
[HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is
located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images
(250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the
velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,
distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a
centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an
enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR
images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an
arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust
condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of
12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the
periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm
the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)
located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps
uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the
center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like
morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the
velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar
feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of
the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect
and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the
ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.

                        We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the
open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity,
\textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main
sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a
positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO
stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS
while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening
effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close
binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the
tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking
hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial
distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the
cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that
tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation
rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during
the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the
rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.

                        Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the
discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an
extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12,
based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000
au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped
stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO
(5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$
km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical
timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of
SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased
temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked
point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$.
Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region,
characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta
(5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70
$\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly
discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely
young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest
that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously
understood.

                        Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from
high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can
effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims
to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately
one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity.
The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence
and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population
Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open
clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and
reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and
homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the
equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral
synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti),
light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the
existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe]
versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns
predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are
present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a
negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and
reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical
evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for
upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and
WEAVE.

                        Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular
clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host
Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark
matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in
the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects
the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological
simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at
a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M
\lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M
\gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely
arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while
the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing
accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence
suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the
presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation
and the resulting star formation.

                        JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10, with a derived UVLF
that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at
characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its
evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum
densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at
6<z<12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce
the SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when
applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed
stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies'
physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming
different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each
6<z<12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are
classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding
physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log
Mstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to
0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only <20% of
low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in
low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator
of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of
galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to
0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from
observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and
0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither
alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z>10. Our results
add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely
responsible for the high-z UVLF.

                        We report the discovery of a possible sub-population of stellar clusters that
appear to follow retrograde orbits around the third largest galaxy in the Local
Group, M33 (Triangulum). This spiral disk galaxy has apparently had a mostly
quiescent existence, although recent discoveries, particularly of a pronounced
warp in the gas and stellar disk, suggest that M33's relatively quiet past was
interrupted at least once by a dynamical interaction with another galaxy. We
suggest that this sub population provides evidence of accretion of one or more
dwarf galaxies in M33's history. We estimate a lower limit for the accreted
halo virial mass of $M_{\rm vir} \sim (7 \pm 3) \times 10^{10}$\msun,
accounting for about 10\% of the virial mass in the halo of M33 that has an
accretion origin. We propose one of these accretion events as the source of the
observed warp in M33's disk.

                        We present early results from a high-resolution analysis ($\sim$100-200pc) of
the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio in twelve nearby galaxies. We use new ALMA
CO(1-0) observations from the Fundamental CO(1-0) Transition Survey (FACTS),
and re-imaged CO(2-1) data from PHANGS. We make empirical classifications based
on the optical and molecular gas morphologies, which show clear systematic
trends in the variation of $R_{21}$ as a function of galactic structure. The
sample includes barred and unbarred, and flocculent galaxies. The barred spiral
galaxies follow a general trend: $R_{21}$ is high in the center, low along the
bar, increases at the bar ends, and then declines in the outer parts of the
disk. The structure dependence suggests the importance of galactic dynamics on
molecular gas evolution, and consequently on star formation, in galaxies.
$R_{21}$ fluctuates in the spiral arms for both barred and unbarred galaxies.
HII regions increase $R_{21}$ locally in their surrounding gas and are often
associated with galactic structures. Together, $R_{21}$ varies systematically
as a function of galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation activity.

                        We analyze the stellar light, 4000 Angstrom break and emission line profiles
of 82 edge-on disk galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We characterize the stellar
light profiles perpendicular to the disk plane using two parameters: a) the
power law slope of the thick disk component, 2) the transition radius where the
profile flattens. The 4000 Angstrom break profiles perpendicular to the plane
are characterized by the number of significant changes in slope (breaks) and by
the change in D_n(4000) from inner to outer disk. The slope correlates tightly
with the stellar mass of the galaxy over the stellar mass range 10^9<log
M*<10^10 M_sun. More massive galaxies have more extended thick disks. The slope
and transition radius exhibit large scatter for galaxies more massive than
10^{10} M_sun. Half the sample have older stellar populations in their thick
disks, a third have flat D$_n$(4000) profiles and 15% have younger thick disks.
The D$_n$(4000) profiles exhibit as many as 4 separate breaks. There are more
breaks in massive galaxies with bulges and more extended thick disks. This may
indicate that the breaks are produced by more frequent accretion events in such
systems. The extra-planar Halpha EQW correlates most strongly with the specific
star formation rate of the galaxy, and the [OII]/Halpha ratio increases with
distance from the disk plane. This increase is most apparent for massive
galaxies with extended thick disk components and low SFR/M* These findings
support the hypothesis that the larger [OII]/Halpha ratios may be caused by
ionization from evolved stars.

                        Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and
majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of
dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context,
we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} >
10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961
non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$
M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a
previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with
merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates
(SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the
median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and
redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and
suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement.
The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in
post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found
to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer
regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts.
This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the
merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given
small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific
SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers
are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime,
where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests
that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more
comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their
evolution.

                        Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our
understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight
into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the
largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of
seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local
$5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures
show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known
star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,
primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are
precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show
an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the
Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary
by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only.
This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal
structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These
findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic
structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and
likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.

                        In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux
concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA
data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm
H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm
H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$
flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find
that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted
stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental
effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation
main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we
find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have
higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass
regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently
occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of
prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy
structure formation are discussed.
