                        SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of
the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the
nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a
bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While
previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we
present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the
12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along
with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also
perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern
tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions,
including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density.
Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are
gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of
active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate
of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material
to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this
work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star
formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically
reshapes the extended tails.

                        In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of
stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios
from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars.
These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field
stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our
empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N])
abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by
combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular
clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as
a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within
the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have
established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that
have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any
extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm
yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This
relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17
sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be
consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and
APO-K2.

                        Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions
remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and
high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot
subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8
\,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet
Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic
Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star
candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this
sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped
stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model
combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV
photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real
Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding,
extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated
stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a
recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous
companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased
toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and
toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show
UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or
improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict
contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars
with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting
higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models
and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.

                        The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of
the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed
with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case
when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes
into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on
the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were
taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the
standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and
the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about
25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model
decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In
addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of
the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is
impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also
compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the
ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of
interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund
2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the
hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.

                        The pre-main-sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars on the
upper main sequence is still a vast mystery and not well understood. Our
analysis of young associations and open clusters aims to find (very) young CP
stars to try to put a lower boundary on the age of such objects. Using three
catalogues of open clusters and associations, we determined membership
probabilities using HDBSCAN. The hot stars from this selection were submitted
to synthetic $\Delta a$ photometry, spectral, and light curve classification to
determine which ones are CP stars and candidates. Subsequently, we used
spectral energy distribution fitting and emission line analysis to check for
possible PMS CP stars. The results were compared to the literature. We detected
971 CP stars and candidates {in 217 clusters and associations}. A relatively
large fraction, $\sim$10\% of those, show characteristics of PMS CP stars. This
significantly expands the known list of candidate PMS CP stars, bringing us
closer to solving the mystery of their origin.

                        Protostellar multiplicity is a common outcome of the star formation process.
To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical
parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically
characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the
physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average
distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO)
observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to
derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in
Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and
c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated
for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were
compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to
search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature
derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values
of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and
c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios
have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on
the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of
10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical
parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary
protostellar systems; ii) multiple (>2 components) protostellar systems tend to
have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars;
iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of
separation between components in protostellar systems.

                        There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with
stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation
rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In
this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to
better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO
observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We
compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency
in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas
masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES
sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for
comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to
molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their
suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient
star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we
argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or
merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments.
Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of
lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic
component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end,
consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.

                        Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides
insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of
large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace
overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test
this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous,
gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55
at $z_\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band
imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space
Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts,
$z_\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for
companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\pm2$ and $15\pm3$ companion
galaxies exist with consistent $z_\text{phot}$ ($dz \leq 0.2$) within a
projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These
correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\delta = 0.1 \pm 0.2$ and ${\delta} =1.0
\pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \pm 0.4)\sigma$ and $(2.2 \pm 0.6)
\sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane,
HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the
overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite
its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of
two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts
of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small
sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster
cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm
the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.

                        We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the
Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail
distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at
$l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO
$J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm
0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses
of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively,
and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of
the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The
temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the
typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or
close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds
are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the
strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds
represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic
plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is
the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the
falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible
implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar
medium are discussed.

                        We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars
on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift
galaxies ($0.02$\,$<$\,z\,$<$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys
DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair
interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of
companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their
host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred
galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more
pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than
unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have
suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual
role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven
enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate
kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when
a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central
starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and
contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting
for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF
regulation in interacting galaxies.
