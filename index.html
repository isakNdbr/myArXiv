                        Stellar population synthesis models are an essential tool with which galaxy
physical parameters are extracted from observations. However they are built on
assumptions designed for use in the local Universe, and not always appropriate
to high redshift galaxies. Here we consider the impact of including the
hitherto-neglected stellar pre-main sequence delay timescale on the
interpretation of composite stellar populations at ages of <1 Gyr. We find that
doing so has an impact on the optical luminosity of very young stellar
populations of up to ~10 per cent, although smaller changes in observed light
(<5 per cent) are expected in most use cases. However the impact on the
inferred stellar mass and mass-to-light ratios is significant (a factor of 2 or
more), depending on how those properties are defined. We find that the short
time scales for star formation in the distant Universe require a clearer
definition for the stellar mass in a population, and will impact assumptions
about the inferred shape of the stellar initial mass function from
observations.

                        Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various
stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The
progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the
James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from
single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful
instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas
and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance
ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice
abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the
importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger
differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or
physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the
data.

                        CO isotopologues are common tracers of the bulk molecular gas in
extragalactic studies, providing insights into the physical and chemical
conditions of the cold molecular gas, a reservoir for star formation. Since
star formation occurs within molecular clouds, mapping CO isotopologues at
cloud-scale is important to understanding the processes driving star formation.
However, achieving this mapping at such scales is challenging and
time-intensive. The Surveying the Whirlpool Galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA
(SWAN) survey addresses this by using the Institut de radioastronomie
millim\'etrique (IRAM) NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to map the
$^{13}$CO(1-0) and C$^{18}$O(1-0) isotopologues, alongside several dense gas
tracers, in the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at high sensitivity and spatial
resolution ($\approx$ 125 pc).We examine the $^{13}$CO(1-0) to C$^{18}$O(1-0)
line emission ratio as a function of galactocentric radius and star formation
rate surface density to infer how different chemical and physical processes
affect this ratio at cloud scales across different galactic environments:
nuclear bar, molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arms. In line with
previous studies conducted at kiloparsec scales for nearby star-forming
galaxies, we find a moderate positive correlation with galactocentric radius
and a moderate negative correlation with star formation rate surface density
across the field-of-view (FoV), with slight variations depending on the
galactic environment. We propose that selective nucleosynthesis and changes in
the opacity of the gas are the primary drivers of the observed variations in
the ratio.

                        We present a comparative test of four widely used full spectral fitting
codes, with the aim of answering the question: how robust is the retrieval of
the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and other stellar properties of
galaxies? We used ALF, PyStaff, Starlight, and pPXF to fit a set of
optical+near-infrared spectroscopic data from the Magellan telescope of the two
brightest galaxies in the Fornax cluster, NGC1399 and NGC1404. By fitting the
same data set with the same models, we can compare the radial trends (out to ~
R_e) of IMF slope, age, metallicity and 19 elemental abundances when allowed
with the four codes. To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried
out parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation
history (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as
ALF and PyStaff, which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP) return
greater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure
SSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return
erroneous results. Although codes like Starlight and pPXF, which retrieve the
best-fit SFH without prior assumptions, tend to produce results with greater
scatter and bias, they are generally more reliable in identifying secondary
components. Our analysis on the two targets shows that ALF and PyStaff, that
assume an SSP, give results pointing to a single old age, a decreasing
metallicity with radius and a flat super-Salpeter IMF. In contrast, Starlight
and pPXF suggest the presence of a secondary component with different
metallicity and IMF characteristics.

                        We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of massive
galaxies ($M_\star \geq 10^{10} \, M_\odot$) in the redshift range $1 < z <
4.5$. We analyze spectro-photometric data combining broadband photometry from
HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained
as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived
through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes,
BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables
a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling
choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution,
significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the
mass-weighted stellar age ($t_M$) and formation redshift ($z_{\mathrm{form}}$),
by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample
exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50\% of their mass between $3 \leq
z \leq 9$. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with
elevated star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon$) at early epochs.
Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly
compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred
formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at $z <
2$. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older ($t_M \sim 1.1$ Gyr) and
assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts.
These findings support the ``downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and
passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.

                        Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the
star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy
evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the
relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for
simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively
low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological
simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its
interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing
drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms
for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent
with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst
galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates
of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold
outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold
interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the
acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties:
stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot
phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the
origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas
mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to
substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables
efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key
multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.

                        We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$)
quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the
evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights
on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust
sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS
database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their
mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the
CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time
since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain
insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in
our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of
cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently
quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority
of QGs observed at $z<1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of
time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$)
are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM,
while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term
effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust
mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in
high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and
significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming
galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after
quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs
already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a
gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.

                        Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple
evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution
as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition
before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may
either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture
supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear
burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron
core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the
production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of
these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various
sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the
strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a
consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C
and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP
coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about
1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the
minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot
higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova
light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production
within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as
deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would
require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a
moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced
mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.
