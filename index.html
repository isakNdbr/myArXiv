                        Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric
and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual
gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a
comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters.
Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs
involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types:
primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and
hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to
quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed
multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster
pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243
pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions.
This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular
cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces.
In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster
systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature
confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery
of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are
involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star
clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a
comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high
fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that
cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work
offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution
of multiple star cluster systems.

                        We present a new independent determination for the age of one of the oldest
open clusters, NGC 188: $6.41 \pm 0.33$ Gyr. We utilize a novel approach where
we jointly fit the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions
(SED) of six binary star systems in the cluster. The joint fit has 21 free
parameters: 12 stellar masses, 6 orbital inclination angles, as well as a
common cluster age, distance, and extinction, $A_V$. The fit to the SEDs
utilizes MIST stellar isochrones, and the fitted stellar parameters are
presented in HR diagrams (R - $T_{\rm eff}$, R - M, and M - $T_{\rm eff}$)
showing the stars' different states of evolution. These isochrones are compared
with PARSEC and Y2 isochrones to obtain an estimate of the uncertainties
introduced by different stellar models. Of the 3017 stars taken from the NGC
188 field, 333 possible member stars were selected using Gaia data and analyzed
separately for their mean distances and proper motions. We find a distance to
NGC 188 of $1850 \pm 12$ pc compared with the independent photometric distance
found from the SED fitting of $1897 \pm 58$ pc.

                        OB associations, as an intermediate stage between Galactic clusters and field
stars, play an important role in understanding the star formation process,
early stellar evolution, and Galactic evolution. In this work, we construct a
large sample of OB stars with 6D phase space parameters ($l, b, d, V_{\rm los},
pmra ,pmdec$) by combining the distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021),
radial velocities derived from low-resolution spectra of the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and proper motions from
the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3). This sample includes 19,933 OB stars,
most of which are located within 6\,kpc of the Sun. Using 6D phase space
parameters and friends-of-friends clustering algorithm, we identify 67 OB
associations and 112 OB association candidates, among them, 49 OB associations
and 107 OB association candidates are newly identified. The Galactic rotation
curve derived using 67 OB association members is relatively flat in the range
of Galactocentric distances 7$<$$R$$<$13\,kpc. The angular rotation velocity at
solar Galactocentric distance of $R_\odot$ =8.34\,kpc is $\Omega_0$ =
29.05$\pm$0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of the 67 OB
associations indicates that they are mainly located at low Galactic latitudes
and near spiral arms of the Milky Way. Additionally, we estimate the velocity
dispersions and sizes of these 67 OB associations. Our results show that the
velocity dispersions decrease as Galactocentric distances increase, while their
sizes increase as Galactocentric distances increase.

                        We investigated colour gradients of photometrically selected post-starburst
galaxies (PSBs) at $0.7 < z < 0.9$ in the COSMOS field as a function of central
concentration of asymmetric features, $C_{A}$, in order to understand their
origins. We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies
(QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS
$I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data. We found
that the colour gradient, $\Delta (I-H) = (I-H)_{in} - (I-H)_{out}$, decreases
with increasing $C_{A}$ for all the three populations. Only PSBs with
$\log{C_{A}} > 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central
asymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young
stars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with
half-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The
positive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$
suggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in
the recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\log C_A <
0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger
sizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.

                        Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen
abundances below $\sim$5% Solar metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\le$7.35). These
galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass-metallicity and
luminosity-metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies
have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where
they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase
oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP
galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system's properties using new imaging from
the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red
giant branch (TRGB) distance (15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the HI gas mass,
the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated,
gas rich (gas fraction $\mu$=0.69), low-mass
(log(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)=6.12$\pm$0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H)=7.32$\pm$0.04),
star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show
that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the
LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system's luminosity.
To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies we
also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken
from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct
method. We find evidence for an anti-correlation between gas-phase oxygen
abundance and HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a
chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.

                        Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 association exists a
region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia
astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups,
all found in a similar location in the sky ($137 \lessapprox l\lessapprox145$
and $-2\lessapprox b \lessapprox5$) and at a similar distance ($\sim$1kpc). In
this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this
region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time,
examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering
of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available
SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr
with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters
overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on
present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct
region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the
clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association,
with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus
arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this
work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a
different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel
through the Galaxy.

                        Context. Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been
widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive
star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack
of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI]
lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used
observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885
sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between
line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm
L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit
the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII
lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses
is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other.
For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm
{M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} =
3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ ,
respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of
SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm
L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and
0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method,
we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and
CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across
different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these
correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.

                        Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming
galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the
circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of
spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model
circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$
emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and
temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the
neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV)
background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three
types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems
with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a
neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in
between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative
transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of
Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and
the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based
on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT
simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy
at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable
recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical
information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$
emission.

                        Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that
interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from
enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star
formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting
cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star
formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features
located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar
populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the
stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,
with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations
are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst
aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star
clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star
formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In
the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and
cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star
formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds
associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the
halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star
formation, producing the observed episodic structure.
