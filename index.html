                        The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been
discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of
giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary
interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are
hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$
disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the
Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can
serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs
thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf
candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper,
we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using
Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm
3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star
from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around
[Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5
dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$,
Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common
formation pathway.

                        SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of
the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the
nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a
bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While
previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we
present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the
12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along
with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also
perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern
tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions,
including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density.
Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are
gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of
active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate
of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material
to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this
work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star
formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically
reshapes the extended tails.

                        In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of
stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios
from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars.
These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field
stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our
empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N])
abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by
combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular
clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as
a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within
the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have
established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that
have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any
extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm
yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This
relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17
sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be
consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and
APO-K2.

                        Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a
more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took
spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young
clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec.
These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption,
features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS
evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3
variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis
of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos
of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution.
Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for
Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate
kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to
isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We
find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their
isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr
before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for
Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies
many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to
overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S
clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been
gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of
unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95
likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since
gas expulsion.

                        We present phosphorus abundance measurements for a total of 102 giant stars,
including 82 stars in 24 open clusters and 20 Cepheids, based on
high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with GIANO-B. Evolution of
phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance,
remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining
precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and
measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines.
Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around
solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies.
We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr,
indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained
by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more
efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher
phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters
younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly
hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass
stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common
chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass
stars.

                        Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components
usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios
were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary
interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings
valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars.
We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the
detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a
dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality
photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we
found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other
systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here
are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are
therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in
the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in
these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature,
rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high
incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong
constraints for star formation models.

                        Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active
star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at
different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to
study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies,
the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$)
among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive
star evolution.
  Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars,
and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate
whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0,
are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the
observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2.
  Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in
Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical
spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using
iacob-broad.
  Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in
fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show
$v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this
threshold.
  Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack
of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three
factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may
imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions;
(ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway
stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation
(reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at
birth.

                        The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of
the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed
with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case
when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes
into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on
the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were
taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the
standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and
the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about
25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model
decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In
addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of
the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is
impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also
compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the
ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of
interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund
2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the
hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.

                        Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM).
Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with
high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical
wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method
based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the
previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective
mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust
structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate
extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying
XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey,
we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that
span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l <
232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and
300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers
higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions
compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane,
providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.

                        A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear
star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC
7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old
stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the
old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of
metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The
young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all
galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.
Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar
age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the
average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include
contributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of
the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population
synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust
lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of
interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar
clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar
winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of
extinction are detected.

                        Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-$z$ star-forming galaxies
depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has
not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm
log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and
high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a
meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$
FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$
[OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at
$z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})
\lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady
state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak
positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these
systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm
eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$
correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical
and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario
where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before
subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot
lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary
process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems,
regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the
canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star
formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z
\gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim
0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.

                        While massive quiescent galaxies are known to be poor in atomic hydrogen
(HI), their true HI content remains poorly constrained due to the limited
sensitivity and morphological biases of existing surveys. We present deep HI
observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent
galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast > 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color
(NUV$-r > 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of
$\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the
predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the
majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$
upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) < -3.46$ derived from stacking the
non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high
fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation
with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST
sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only
includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and
its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three
different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions,
background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in
the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type
morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs,
neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that
additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI
deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.

                        We present a statistical study of spatially resolved chemical enrichment in
18 main-sequence galaxies at $z=4$--6, observed with \jwst/NIRSpec IFU as part
of the ALPINE-CRISTAL-\jwst\ survey. Performing an optimized reduction and
calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage
masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust
emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions
vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements
in [O\,\textsc{iii}]/H$\beta$, [O\,\textsc{ii}]/[O\,\textsc{iii}],
[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6732}$/[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6718}$, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and
$L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm UV}$, consistent with elevated electron density, dust
obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and
ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by
recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient
is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, $\Delta \log({\rm O/H}) = 0.02 \pm 0.01$
dex kpc$^{-1}$, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows,
and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations,
we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR).
Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR
surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ than
seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes
linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous
$\sim$1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient
and a stronger coupling between star formation and metallicity than observed in
evolved systems in the local universe.

                        Protostellar multiplicity is a common outcome of the star formation process.
To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical
parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically
characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the
physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average
distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO)
observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to
derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in
Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and
c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated
for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were
compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to
search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature
derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values
of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and
c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios
have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on
the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of
10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical
parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary
protostellar systems; ii) multiple (>2 components) protostellar systems tend to
have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars;
iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of
separation between components in protostellar systems.

                        There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with
stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation
rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In
this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to
better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO
observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We
compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency
in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas
masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES
sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for
comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to
molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their
suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient
star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we
argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or
merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments.
Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of
lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic
component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end,
consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.
