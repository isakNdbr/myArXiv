                        The interstellar medium (ISM) exhibits complex, multi-scale structures that
are challenging to study due to their projection into two-dimensional (2D)
column density maps. We present the Volume Density Mapper, a novel algorithm
based on constrained diffusion to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) density
distributions of molecular clouds from 2D observations. This method decomposes
the column density into multi-scale components, reconstructing a 3D density
field that preserves key physical properties such as mean density, maximum
density, and standard deviation along the line of sight. Validated against
numerical simulations (FLASH and ENZO), the algorithm achieves high accuracy,
with mean density estimates within 0.1 dex and dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex
across varied cloud structures. The reconstructed 3D density fields enable the
derivation of critical parameters, including volume density, cloud thickness,
and density probability distribution functions, offering insights into star
formation and ISM evolution. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by
applying diverse systems from galaxies (NGC 628) to protostellar disks. The
code is available at https://github.com/gxli/volume-density-mapper.

                        We present a multiwavelength catalog of mid-infrared-selected compact sources
in 19 nearby galaxies, combining JWST NIRCam/MIRI, HST UV-optical broadband,
H$\alpha$ narrow-band, and ALMA CO observations. We detect 24,945 compact
sources at 21 $\mu$m and 55,581 at 10 $\mu$m. Artificial star tests show 50%
completeness limits of $\sim$5 $\mu$Jy for the 10 $\mu$m catalog, and $\sim$24
$\mu$Jy for the 21 $\mu$m catalog. We find that 21 $\mu$m compact sources
contribute $\sim$20% of the total galaxy emission in that band, but only
contribute $5%$ at 10 $\mu$m. We classify sources using stellar evolution and
population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived
from the literature. Our classifications include H$\alpha$-bright and
dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and
carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types. In sampling a broad
range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized
selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar
populations. We find that H$\alpha$-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty
(likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint
phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the H$\alpha$-bright stage. The
luminosity functions of 10 and 21 $\mu$m sources follow power-law
distributions, with the 21 $\mu$m slope ($-1.7 \pm 0.1$) similar to that of
giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming
complexes, while the 10 $\mu$m slope ($-2.0 \pm 0.1$) is closer to that of
young stellar clusters.

                        We report the discovery of a new subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars, characterized by high absolute carbon abundances (A(C) > 7.39)
and extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H] $<=$ -3.1) but notably lacking
enhancements in neutron-capture elements, thus falling under the CEMP-no
category. This population emerged from a detailed analysis of low-resolution
spectroscopic data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), where the
observed frequency trends with the decreasing metallicity of CEMP-s
(s-process-enhanced) and CEMP-no (no neutron-capture enhanced) stars deviated
from established expectations. In contrast to earlier findings, we observe a
rise in high-A(C) stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, which we interpret as a distinct
group not accounted for in traditional CEMP classifications. Following the
Yoon-Beers group classification, we define these stars as Group IV. Statistical
modeling confirms their presence as a separate peak in the A(C) distribution,
and available radial velocity data suggest that about 30% of Group IV stars may
be binaries, indicating possible binary-related formation mechanisms. This
discovery challenges the current CEMP-no star formation pathways and implies
the existence of alternative or hybrid enrichment scenarios in the early
Universe. High-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of Group IV candidates will
be crucial for identifying their progenitors and understanding their
evolutionary implications.

                        We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is
affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a
galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass
range [600 - 24000] $M_{\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$)
and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce
the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age
function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\sim$ 5000
$M_{\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We
find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most
likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in
survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses
below 6000 $M_{\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can
protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and
thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared
to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the
$C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which
is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between
the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr
the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.

                        Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted
by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern
the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using
the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of ``embeddedness'',
identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to
exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its
maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which
accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually
balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their
maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars
are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud,
driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their
fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate
the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that
emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the
cloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and
H$\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2
Myrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest
that deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those
partially exposed. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous
stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local
event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.

                        Kinematic information is crucial for understanding the evolution of complex
systems, such as interstellar gas. Obtaining full 3D kinematic information is a
crucial final step for modeling and interpretation. Molecular clouds are
nurseries where stars are born. Stars at a very early stage, like young stellar
objects (YSOs), inherit the spatial and kinematic structure of the gas patches
they originate from. In this paper, we combine measurements of radial
velocities towards the gas and the kinematic information of YSOs from Gaia DR3
to derive 3D velocities of a sample of YSO (Young Stellar Object)-MC (Molecular
Cloud) complexes at d$\lesssim$3.5kpc from the Sun. We find that the molecular
interstellar medium traced by the YSO-MC complexes generally follows Galactic
rotation, with an additional peculiar velocity of 8.6 km s$^{-1}$. The random
motion of these complexes in the Galactic XY plane is more energetic than
motion along the Z direction. A catalogue containing the 3D velocities of the
YSO-MC complexes at different reference frames is available, and the distances
and 3D velocities of well-known molecular clouds are presented. Our results set
the foundation for exploring the interplay between the Galaxy, the molecular
ISM, and star formation. Data available at

                        Studies in the past few decades have investigated young stellar object
evolution based on their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED is heavily
influenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young
star. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star
formation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the
framework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel
spectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object
morphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes.
Thereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological
classification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future,
revisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey
images from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object
candidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a
Self-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method,
we created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared
images. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of
the different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index,
via Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of
young stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from
observational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In
addition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging
to any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from
near-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify
characteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary
stages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological
classification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future.

                        We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their
position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from
redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to
filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether
these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy
population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies,
robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas
depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the
cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton
using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament.
After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate
(SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions
as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent
modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z
\gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion,
reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend
in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances
($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores,
suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are
not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at
low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity
modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas
supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms
dominating across cosmic time.

                        Accurate measurements of young stellar cluster internal dynamics provide
crucial insights into their formation. With Gaia, we are now able to trace
stellar motions and study the dynamics of star clusters with unprecedented
precision, but this requires a reliable list of probable members. We examine a
2 deg-radius region in Cepheus OB4, centered on the young cluster Berkeley 59,
to build a reliable candidate member list, enabling the study of the cluster's
structure, kinematics, and stellar population. We compiled a catalog of optical
and near-infrared photometry, along with precise positions and proper motions
from Gaia DR3, for sources in the Cepheus OB4 field. Membership probabilities
were determined using a probabilistic random forest algorithm and further
refined by requiring HR diagram positions consistent with a young age. From a
list of 1030 probable members, we estimate a distance of 1009+-12 pc to
Berkeley 59. Masses, extinction, and ages were derived by fitting the spectral
energy distributions to atmospheric and evolutionary models, while internal
dynamics was analyzed using proper motions relative to the cluster's mean
motion. Berkeley 59 exhibits an asymmetric expansion pattern with velocity
increasing outward and a preferred motion toward the north. The IMF between 0.4
and 7 MSun follows a single power law (dN/dM \propto M**-alpha), with the slope
alpha=2.3+-0.3, consistent with Salpeter's slope and previous studies in the
region. The region's median age, estimated from the HR diagram, is 2.9 Myr. The
velocity dispersion of Berkeley 59 exceeds the virial velocity dispersion
derived from its total mass (650+-30 MSun) and half-mass radius (1.71+-0.13
pc). The 2D motions of a stellar group located about 1 deg north of Berkeley 59
provide further support for the previously proposed triggered star formation
scenario. (Abridged)

                        We re-evaluate the star formation history of the nearby Sco-Cen OB
Association with a comprehensive analysis of Gaia XP spectra of more than 7,800
potential members. New spectral classifications are obtained by fitting
individual XP spectra with templates derived from empirical spectra of young
stars. Combining these spectral classifications in this work and in the
literature with archival photometry leads to estimates of V-band extinction and
stellar luminosities for a total of 8,846 sources. Employing SPOTS models with
spot coverages of 0.34 and 0.51 for K and M-type stars harmonizes age estimates
between K/M-type and F/G-type stars, with ages older than are obtained for
low-mass stars from standard evolutionary models. These older ages lead to a
disk lifetime that is approximately two times longer than reported in previous
literature. Our re-evaluation of the star formation history with these revised
age estimates uncovers evidence of underlying substructures within the Sco-Cen
complex.

                        We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), $\alpha$-elements (O, Ne, Si,
and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-$z$ star-forming
galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from
the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564
sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.46$
and a median star-formation rate of
$\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to
the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our
564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low
[Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of
$12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields
of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak
SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen
abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the
Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting
silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than
that we newly derive for two individual $z>6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248)
with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of
$M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope
$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin
and the blue-$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O
ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the
all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with
rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming
galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O
enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.

                        The relation between metallicity and galaxy mass (the so-called
mass-metallicity relation) is the strongest and most prominent among scaling
relations between chemical enrichment and galactic properties. However, it is
unclear whether this relation primarily traces metal retention or the
integrated production of metals, as past studies have obtained contrasting
results. We investigate this issue through an extensive Random Forest and
Partial Correlations analysis of spectral cubes of 4,500 galaxies from the
MaNGA survey. We find that stellar mass ($\rm M_*$) and baryonic gravitational
potential ($\rm \Phi_* = M_*/R_e$) are the two most important quantities
determining gas metallicity in galaxies. However, their relative roles strongly
depend on the galactocentric radius -- the metallicity within 1~$\rm R_e$
depends primarily on the stellar mass, while the metallicity at radii beyond
1.5~$\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the gravitational potential. This finding
can be interpreted in terms of metals in the central region ($\rm R\leq 1~R_e$)
being mostly bound, regardless of the global gravitational potential and,
therefore, the metallicity is determined primarily by the cumulative production
of metals (hence the integrated star formation history, i.e. $\rm M_*$); by
contrast, in the galactic peripheries the retention of metals depends more
critically on the gravitational potential, hence the stronger dependence of the
metallicity on $\rm \Phi_*$ at large radii. Our finding reconciles apparent
discrepancies between previous results. Finally, we find that the Star
Formation Rate is the third most important parameter (after $\rm M_*$ and $\rm
\Phi_*$) in determining the metallicity, as expected from the Fundamental
Metallicity Relation.

                        In dwarf galaxies, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are believed to primarily
form from the migration and merger of globular clusters (GCs), with a possible
contribution from in-situ star-forming activity triggered by gas infall. We
present the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including
ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using
the F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface
brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies
with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's
high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We
modeled the NSCs with a S\'ersic profile and derived their structural
properties and photometry. We find the NSC S\'ersic index to increase with the
luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective
radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile,
whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive
NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including
in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more
massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be
due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive
NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More
observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation
scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.

                        We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB
association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its
formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along
with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising
sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion
correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion
coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day
expansion rate of about 10--12\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star
clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older
ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion
and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star
formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly
suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star
formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize
the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB
associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution
age maps.

                        UGCA 320 is a gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy which belongs to a nearby,
relatively isolated group of dwarf galaxies. Here, we combine multi-band HST
imaging data with deep long-slit SALT/RSS and integral-field VLT/MUSE spectral
data to study the stellar and ionized gas components of UGCA 320. Our imaging
data analysis reveals a very blue (V-I~0.1 mag), flattened radial colour
profile. We detect an abundance of ionized gas in UGCA 320 powered mostly by
recent star formation. The stellar disc in UGCA 320 is populated predominantly
by young (~120 Myr) and metal-poor (~15-30 per cent solar metallicity) stars
and it rotates in the same sense as the ionized gas disc but with higher
rotation velocities, and possibly in different planes. Our analysis reveals a
sharp transition in the kinematic properties of the discs at radius ~10" (~0.3
kpc) and distortions in the outer disc region. We show that these features are
consistent with a recent tidal interaction most likely with its close neighbour
- UGCA 319. We discuss our results in the context of interacting dwarf galaxies
and also show that similar inferences can be made independently from the
long-slit data analysis as with the integral-field data.
