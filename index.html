                        We present Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectroscopy for the host galaxies
of 12 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder
(ASKAP) observed through the ESO Large Programme "FURBY", which imposes strict
selection criteria on the included FRBs and their host galaxies to produce a
homogeneous and well-defined sample. We describe the data reduction and
analysis of these spectra and report their redshifts, line-emission fluxes, and
derived host properties. From the present sample, this paper focuses on the
faint host of FRB ($m_R = 22.53 \pm 0.02$) identified at low redshift
($z=0.1050$). This indicates an intrinsically very low-luminosity galaxy ($L
\approx 10^8 L_\odot$), making it the lowest-luminosity non-repeating FRB host
to date by a factor of $\sim 3$, and slightly dimmer than the lowest-luminosity
host for repeating FRBs. Our SED fitting analysis reveals a low stellar mass
($M_* \approx 10^{8.0} M_\odot$), low star formation rate (${\rm SFR} \approx
0.04 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$), and very low metallicity
($12+\log(\text{O}/\text{H})\sim(7.99-8.3)$), distinct from the more massive
galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim 10$) that are commonly identified for
non-repeating FRBs. Its discovery demonstrates that FRBs can arise in among the
faintest, metal-poor galaxies of the universe. In turn, this suggests that at
least one FRB progenitor channel must include stars (or their remnants) created
in very low metallicity environments. This indicates better prospects for
detecting FRBs from the high-$z$ universe where young, low-mass galaxies
proliferate.

                        Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding
galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies
the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus
molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its
star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel
images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method,
identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass
segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived
properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles,
constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass
distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation
efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core
formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.

                        The understanding of mixing processes in stars is crucial for improving our
knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar photospheres and of their
variation with evolutionary phase. This is fundamental for many astrophysical
issues on all scales, ranging from stellar evolution to the chemical
composition, formation and evolution of stellar clusters and galaxies. Among
these processes, convective-envelope overshooting is in dire need of a
systematic calibration and comparison with predictions from multi-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. The Red Giant Branch bump (RGBb) is an ideal
calibrator of overshooting processes, since its luminosity depends on the
maximum depth reached by the convective envelope after the first dredge-up.
Indeed, a more efficient overshooting produces a discontinuity in the Hydrogen
mass fraction profile deeper in the stellar interior and consequently a less
luminous RGBb. In this work, we calibrated the overshooting efficiency by
comparing the RGBb location predicted by stellar models with observations of
stellar clusters with HST and Gaia photometry, as well as solar-like
oscillating giants in the Kepler field. We explored the metallicity range
between -2.02 dex and +0.35 dex and found overshooting efficiencies ranging
from $0.009^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ to $0.062^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$. In particular, we
found that the overshooting efficiency decreases linearly with [M/H], with a
slope of $(-0.010\pm0.006)$ dex$^{-1}$. We suggest a possible explanation for
this trend, linking it to the efficiency of turbulent entrainment at different
metallicities.

                        Split main-sequences (MSs) and extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) have
been observed in nearly all Magellanic Clouds clusters younger than 2 Gyr. More
recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet photometry uncovered a
puzzling new population of UV-absorbed stars, dubbed UVdim, in five Magellanic
Clouds clusters aged between 40 and 200 Myr, as well as in one 1.5 Gyr-old
cluster. These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed
of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from
dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds
and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet
been investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining
Swift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars
to 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams
analogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of
UVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim
candidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs
suggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their
Milky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.

                        Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and
environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation
history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the
possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods.
We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular
gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784.
The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed
using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a
regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular
gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be
explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to
CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion
following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas
collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc,
shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in
GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion
may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a
high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have
undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity.
The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed
encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in
progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent
evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers
beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of
GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.

                        Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio
galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of
the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on
the other. These unique sources provide valuable insights into the physical
mechanisms behind the FR dichotomy. In this study, we report the discovery of
thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the
southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line
survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities, with
a median value of 4.4 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located
within the redshift range 0.04 < z < 1.34. To gain further insights into their
origin, we also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of
their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated
near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that
extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are
high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), hosted by actively star-forming
galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that hybrid morphology may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a
dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one
jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection
of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still
necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.

                        We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of
observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare
a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled
approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing,
which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT
has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate
densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and
other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent
with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at
least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at $z = 14$ as compared to $z = 12$ at
$M_{ab}$ $\le$ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy
initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than
about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at $z =
12$-14 with $M_{ab} \le -15$. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results
in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before
the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback
and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star
formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.

                        We investigate the relationships between infrared excess (IRX=$L_{\rm
IR}/L_{\rm UV}$) and Balmer decrement (${\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta$) as
indicators of dust attenuation for 609 ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions at
scales of $\sim 50-200$ pc in NGC 628, utilizing data from AstroSat, James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our
findings indicate that about three fifths of the sample ${\rm {H\,{\small
II}}}$ regions reside within the regime occupied by local star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) along the dust attenuation correlation described by their corresponding
color excess parameters $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX} = 0.51\,E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm
H}\beta}$. Nearly 27$\%$ of the sample exhibits $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}> E(B-V)_{{\rm
H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$, while a small fraction ($\sim 13\%$) displays
significantly lower $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ compared to $E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm
H}\beta}$. These results suggest that the correlation between the two dust
attenuation indicators no longer holds for spatially resolved ${\rm {H\,{\small
II}}}$ regions. Furthermore, the ratio of $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ to $E(B-V)_{{\rm
H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$ remains unaffected by various physical parameters of
the ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions, including star formation rate (SFR), SFR
surface density, infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), $L_{\rm IR}$ surface
density, stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, circularized radius, and the
distance to galactic center. We argue that the ratio is primarily influenced by
the evolution of surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) of the star-forming
regions, transitioning from an early dense and thick phase to the late
blown-away stage.
