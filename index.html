                        We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate
interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While
our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also
predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed
sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given
density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing
quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time
throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column
density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably
accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore
the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column
density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate
densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to
decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our
simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find
this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and
embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is
significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the
relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several
possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly
constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the
sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence"
is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law
velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight
path lengths.

                        We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$
Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography
Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic
redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO,
zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured
cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as
observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived
redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected
from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR
emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of
`fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our
foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated
stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For
sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) =
[9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$,
respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck
$N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* /
M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass
end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with
predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based
observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.

                        Aims. The aim of this work is to determine the maximum ages that can be
unambiguously established for $\delta$ Sct stars using seismic observables,
and, by extension, the oldest open clusters that can be dated using this type
of star. Methods. I estimate the large frequency separation using various
techniques applied to two samples of $\delta$ Sct located near the red edge of
the instability strip. One sample consists of 18 targets observed by the Kepler
mission, and the other comprises 17 targets observed by TESS. I employ a grid
of stellar models representative of typical $\delta$ Sct parameters,
incorporating mass, metallicity, and rotation as independent variables, and
compute the first eight radial modes for each model. Using the observed
spectroscopic temperature, and the estimated large separation, I estimate the
age of each star by fitting a weighted probability density function to the age
distribution of the models that best match the seismic constraints. Results. To
evaluate the performance of the fitting method, it was applied to a synthetic
population of 20 $\delta$ Sct stars with varying metallicities and ages,
generated by randomly selecting models. The analysis indicates that $\delta$
Sct stars older than 1 Gyr, but still prior to reaching the terminal-age main
sequence, can in principle be reliably age-dated. Nevertheless, when the method
is applied to the observational sample, only three out of the 35 stars
considered marginally exceed an estimated age of 1 Gyr. Conclusions. From these
results, I can say that open clusters older than approximately 1 Gyr cannot be
reliably dated using astero-seismology of $\delta$ Sct stars with 1D models, at
least not without a more complete treatment of convection and a non-linear
treatment of rotation.

                        Although asteroseismology is regarded as the most powerful tool for probing
stellar interiors, seismic modelling remains dependent on global stellar
parameters. Stellar clusters offer direct measurements of these parameters by
fitting a CMD, making the application of asteroseismology in clusters a
valuable approach to advancing stellar physics modelling. We aimed to develop
seismic modelling for gravity-mode pulsators in the open cluster NGC 2516 to
determine stellar ages. We computed 1D stellar models using MESA, incorporating
rotation-induced transport processes. Exponential overshooting was included, as
well as rotationally induced mixing in the radiative envelope. Grids of
evolutionary models were computed covering isochrone-derived mass ranges. The
models were evolved up to 300 Myr because of the cluster's young age (~100Myr).
By fitting the frequencies of identified modes of four gravity-mode member
pulsators simultaneously, we measure the seismic age of the cluster NGC 2516 as
132+-8Myr. This high-precision seismic age estimate deviates by 1sigma from the
isochronal age derived from public MIST isochrones for rotating stars. Our
findings show that seismic modelling strongly constrains core overshooting, but
because the period spacing patterns are smooth, it provides weak constraints on
mixing in the radiative envelopes. The two most massive gravity-mode pulsators
have MIST masses ~2.0M_sun while their seismic masses are 1.75M_sun. We
constructed new asteroseismology-calibrated isochrones using input physics
identical to that of our seismic model grid. While this resolves the age
discrepancy, the mass discrepancy is only partially addressed. The remaining
small yet persisting mass discrepancy implies a mismatch between the physics in
core to surface environments of 1D stellar models and the seismic observables
probing those areas of fast-rotating stars.

                        Spectral line surveys of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) have led to the
detection of more than 100 new molecular species, making it the most prolific
source of interstellar molecular discoveries. These wide-band, high-sensitivity
line surveys have been enabled by advances in telescope and receiver
technology, particularly at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In this
work, we present a statistical analysis of the molecular inventory of TMC-1 as
probed by the GOTHAM large program survey from 3.9 to 36.4 GHz. To fully unlock
the potential of the $\sim$29 GHz spectral bandwidth, we developed an automated
pipeline for data reduction and calibration. We applied a Bayesian approach
with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the calibrated spectra and constrained
column densities for 102 molecular species detected in TMC-1, including 75 main
isotopic species, 20 carbon-13 substituted species, and seven
deuterium-substituted species. This list of the detected gas-phase molecules is
populated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, in stark contrast to the oxygen-rich
organics found in sublimated ices around protostars. Of note, ten individual
aromatic molecules were identified in the GOTHAM observations, contributing
0.011% of the gas-phase carbon budget probed by detected molecules when
including CO and 6% when excluding CO. This work provides a reference set of
observed gas-phase molecular abundances for interstellar clouds, offering a new
benchmark for astrochemical theoretical models.

                        Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial
for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the
large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of
3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust
reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive
parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and
includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size,
mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our
catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740
clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high
Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the
cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk,
including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more
detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our
understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and
provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog
serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic
structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM
features.

                        We used observations from the \emph{JWST} Emission Line Survey (JELS) to
measure the half-light radii ($r_{e}$) of 23 H$\alpha$-emitting star-forming
(SF) galaxies at $z=6.1$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field. Galaxy sizes were measured
in \emph{JWST} Near-infrared Camera observations in rest-frame H$\alpha$
(tracing recent star formation) with the F466N and F470N narrowband filters
from JELS, and compared against rest-$R$-band, $V$-band (tracing established
stellar populations) and near-ultraviolet sizes. We find a size-stellar mass
($r_{e}-M_{*}$) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature
values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large
scatter in $r_{e}$ at low stellar mass ($M_{*}<10^{8.4}$ M$_{\odot}$) which we
believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies
at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas
components are similar in size at $z=6.1$. The evidence of already-established
stellar components in these H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) indicates previous
episodes of star formation have occurred. As such, following other JELS studies
finding our HAEs are undergoing a current burst of star formation, we believe
our results indicate that SF galaxies at the end of the EoR have already
experienced a bursty SFH. From our $r_{e}-M_{*}$ relationship, we find $r_{e,
\text{F444W}}=0.76\pm0.46$ kpc for fixed stellar mass $M_{*}=10^{9.25}$
M$_{\odot}$, which is in agreement with other observations and simulations of
star forming galaxies in the literature. We find a close-pair (major) merger
fraction of ($f_{\text{maj. merger}}=0.44\pm0.22$)
$f_{\text{merger}}=0.43\pm0.11$ for galaxy separations $d\lesssim25$ kpc, which
is in agreement with other $z\approx6$ studies.

                        The central regions of disc galaxies host a rich variety of stellar
structures: nuclear discs, bars, bulges, and boxy-peanut (BP) bulges. These
components are often difficult to disentangle, both photometrically and
kinematically, particularly in star-forming galaxies where dust obscuration and
complex stellar motions complicate interpretation. In this work, we use data
from the GECKOS-MUSE survey to investigate the impact of dust on axisymmetric
Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) models, and assess their
ability to recover kinematic structure in edge-on disc galaxies. We construct
JAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \gtrapprox 85^\circ$) galaxies
that span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic
complexity. We find that when dust is appropriately masked, the disc regions of
each galaxy are fit to $\chi^2_{\text{reduced}}\leq 5$. We analyse
two-dimensional residual velocity fields to identify signatures of
non-axisymmetric structure. We find that derived dynamical masses are constant
within 10% for each galaxy across all dust masking levels. In NGC 3957, a
barred boxy galaxy in our sample, we identify velocity residuals that persist
even under aggressive dust masking, aligned with bar orbits and supported by
photometric bar signatures. We extend this analysis to reveal a bar in IC 1711
and a possible side-on bar in NGC 0522. Our results highlight both the
capabilities and limitations of JAM in dusty, edge-on systems and attempt to
link residual velocities to known non-axisymmetric kinematic structure.
