                        Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution
of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a
multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located
at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars
in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared
data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar
objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age,
mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength
suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded
YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in
this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope
(DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting,
most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with
the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative
proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative
of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the
Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas
in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple
analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage,
and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in
the BRC region due to radiative feedback.

                        We present an overview of the final data release (DR2) from the Green Bank
Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map
all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 7$~mag visible
from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key molecular
tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed:
Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333,
L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A
(North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis
(CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar
to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH$_3$ emission and dust
continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH$_3$
emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense
cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent
cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common
throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the
high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity
dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$
column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the
NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_{\rm kin}$, vary systematically
between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean
value and spread of $\sigma_v$ and $T_{\rm kin}$ with increasing star formation
activity. The data presented in this paper are publicly available via
\dataset[DOI: 10.11570/24.0091]{https://doi.org/10.11570/24.0091}.

                        Star formation drives changes in the compositions of galaxies, fusing H and
He into heavier nuclei. This paper investigates the differences in abundance
evolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic
chemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy
arises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean
Galactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar
metallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined
with increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy
exists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We
demonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise
measurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in
the Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and
lower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently
precise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of
non-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical
constraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis. We forecast that only $\sim$4 additional measurements of
$^3$He/$^4$He within $\sim$$3$ kpc of the Sun are required to measure the
primordial $^3$He/$^4$He ratio at $\sim$30\% precision. In parallel, empirical
benchmarks on metal yields also have the power to inform stellar models, since
absolute yield calculations carry factor of $\sim$$2-3$ uncertainties related
to various complex processes (e.g., rotational mixing, convection, mass loss,
failed supernovae).

                        Classical Cepheids (CCs) in Galactic open clusters (OCs) provide essential
observational constraints for calibrating the period-age relation (PAR) and the
period-Wesenheit relation (PWR) of CCs. However, distant and long-period OC
Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise
determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In
this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an
extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining
astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs
associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC
Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected
associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the
41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters
derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age
= (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to
WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the
sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period
confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly
discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the
PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated
parallaxes, respectively.

                        We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES
survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection
of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05)
to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses,
star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the
highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2
M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk,
consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass
of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of
log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems
detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit
broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with
both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the
galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the
redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of
obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but
the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with
samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular
gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples.
We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great
to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult
below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual
galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to
the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential
impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.

                        Young stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, but older stars are
evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for
cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular
clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides,
caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial
direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and
drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and
remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the
cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing
exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} =
\sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's
density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides
can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like
elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish
cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.

                        Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide
range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The
formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within
them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular,
the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and
prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we
conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant
molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the
interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving
down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By
introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas
during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how
much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the
gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is
gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the
warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular
clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$
cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas
on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions
assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven
supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small
contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.

                        We present results from a dual narrow-band imaging survey targeting the
CL1604 supercluster at z = 0.9 using the Subaru Telescope. By combining the
NB921 filter on HSC and the NB1244 filter on SWIMS, we can detect redshifted
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines from the supercluster. This unique
technique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction
for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that
dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$
ratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas
relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among
galaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$), the
dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main
sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this
relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density
environments. Although stellar mass, SFR, and galaxy color are clearly
influenced by environment, we detect no strong, systematic environmental
dependence of dust extinction for the whole sample.

                        Understanding how the Milky Way's present-day structure was shaped by past
major mergers is a key goal of Galactic archaeology. The chemical and dynamical
structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major
accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day
orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the
merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological
zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages,
and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that
stars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and
chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and
metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al.
(2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context.
The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as
[Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The
median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar,
though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported
by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest
metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained
across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like
a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion
space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched
core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of
accreted stars.
