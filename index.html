                        LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the
Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as
catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region,
which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth
analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne
Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to
observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the
C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each
of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic
temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute
the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical
insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of
mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess
the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified
clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion
(RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our
results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within
the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low
interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps
independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional
compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of
RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the
instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

                        Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their
formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of
the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass,
envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against
observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the
near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the
inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to
yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image
profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of
protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR
images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA
Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via
comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting
pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined
with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties.
We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A,
finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED
fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more
distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST
limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher
resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand
the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.

                        Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The
clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense
embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas
expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On
the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at
a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the
densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected
for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star
formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent
estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have
applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law
that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The
second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest
OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local
values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between
$736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$,
depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than
previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the
incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$
50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring
in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from
the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with
clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

                        Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that
interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from
enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star
formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting
cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star
formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features
located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar
populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the
stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,
with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations
are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst
aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star
clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star
formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In
the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and
cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star
formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds
associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the
halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star
formation, producing the observed episodic structure.

                        How does molecular cloud chemistry change with metallicity? In this work, we
study the relation between molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) and carbon monoxide (CO)
at $1/2$ and $1/5$ solar metallicity using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy
obtained as part of the UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards
(ULLYSES) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program. We determine CO column
densities or upper limits for a sample of 50 lines of sight through the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). $^{12}$CO is detected along eight
lines of sight and $^{13}$CO is detected along two. Combining our new CO column
densities with $N_{H_2}$ measurements from the literature, we find that the
evolution of $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ from the Milky Way to the LMC and SMC is a
relatively shallow function of metallicity. Taking $N_{CO}>3\times10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ as a threshold value above which CO emission is likely to be
detectable at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds, the $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ at
which a sightline has a 50% probability of having $N_{CO}$ above this threshold
is 20.8 in the Milky Way, 20.9 in the LMC, and 21.1 in the SMC. This is an 0.3
dex change in threshold $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ over an 0.7 dex change in
metallicity. We compare our measurements with $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ relations from
literature chemical models and find that the measured relations agree best with
models in which the dynamical timescale is longer than the chemical timescale
for $H_2$ but shorter than the chemical timescale for CO.

                        We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a
starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is
triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated
with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b
(v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between
0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9".
The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an
intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the
component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s
component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the
complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features
of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes
of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps
belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time
of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600
km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced
SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas
compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF
in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in
more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas
accompanied by blast-wave shocks.

                        Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying
the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major
molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps
constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to
variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as
a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to
validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on
far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar
reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening
maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to
$E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH
emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH
abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction
significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that
modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared
emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in
PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m
PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared
emission.

                        The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important
theoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events
trigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to
interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked
a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection
between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which
describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We
show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal
Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF
parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying
assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new
approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling
observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP
framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time
models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.

                        We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a
prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial
scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of
molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a
wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B
and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal
tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0)
luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$,
corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$
assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation
efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to
or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a
velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low,
mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the
ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity
component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our
mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner
tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of
total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation.
While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail,
our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.
