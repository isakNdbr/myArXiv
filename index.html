                        We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an
early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the
formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star
clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the
existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8
km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds
reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting
cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad
bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An
elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along
the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a
collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD
model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale,
density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.

                        We derive semi-analytic solutions for the thermally driven cumulative outflow
from a dense stellar cluster that consists of a large number of stars with
strong stellar winds, under the key assumption that their mass and energy
deposition can be treated as a continuous source of thermalized wind material.
Our approach provides explicit analytic forms for the flow critical radius and
sound speed, which then allows for full solution by inward/outward integration
from this critical radius. Application to previous models that assume either a
power-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their
velocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass
depositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by
Plummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius
scaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar,
asymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and
anchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By
deriving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain
scaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling
generally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from
adiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization
suggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in
dense clusters. The simplified semi-analytic method presented here can be
readily applied to alternative mass depositions and so form a basis for
interpreting results from detailed numerical simulations of outflows from young
stellar clusters.

                        We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina
star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared
Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey
and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky
Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified
606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised
K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs
in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined
with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line
YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross
validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports
Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO
variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability
patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is
consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar
parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs,
dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures
between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more
massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in
Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset
for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.

                        The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo
mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of
normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC
systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both
relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship
is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic
fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from
the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the
galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic
way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count.
This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently
lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent
`failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later
assembly.

                        In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates
radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited
by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by
photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$,
offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of
metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of
these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at
cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared
spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We
conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily
methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to
40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or
CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice
matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield
likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O
ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative
pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall,
our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important
channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where
radical mobility is limited.

                        High-mass young stellar objects exhibit episodic accretion bursts similar to
their low-mass counterparts. Understanding these outbursts is crucial for
elucidating massive star formation and disk evolution around high-mass
protostars. We investigate thermal instability's role in triggering accretion
outbursts using a two-dimensional hydrodynamical model that fully resolves the
vertical structure of the inner disk. This approach provides a more realistic
depiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst
signatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk
around a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative
transport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional
studies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk
structure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show
thermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature
gradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows
differing between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year
outbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\times10^{-4}~\rm
M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently
bright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack
the "reflares" seen in one-dimensional calculations. Resolving full vertical
disk structure is essential for accurate thermal instability modeling. While
thermal instability significantly influences episodic accretion, it appears
insufficient alone to explain observed HMYSO outburst diversity. Additional
mechanisms are required for comprehensive understanding.

                        Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance
estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates
distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying
distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction
patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance
measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In
this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance
Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these
observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity
to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2)
minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and
(3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve
the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for
extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO
survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision
parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas
distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate
distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of
gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a
full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights
into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen.
These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and
physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.

                        Galactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are known to be complex, multiphase
systems consisting of neutral and/or ionized gas moving at high velocities
relative to the rotation of the disk. In this work, we investigate Milky
Way-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties,
morphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving
with neutral HVCs visible in HI. We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope
around the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs) it is prolate
in morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ~6 times greater than the
neutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion possible from the
ionized gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$) than the neutral gas
($\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$), consistent with estimates made from observations of
our own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs
around 47 Milky Way-like galaxies and find that $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ scales
with $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$, and both scale with the star formation rate of
the galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ could
account for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can
sufficiently cool and condense), while $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$ can only balance
11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a
defining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.

                        Interstellar ices play a fundamental role in the physical and chemical
evolution of molecular clouds and star-forming regions, yet their large-scale
distribution and abundance remain challenging to map. In this work, I present
the ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth
($\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\mu$m absorption feature,
which is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method
builds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses
widely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of
passband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice
color excess metric $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal
choice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely
available photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the
method, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the
background of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured
optical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably
tight correlation between $\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$.
This photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of
the interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to
spectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental
dependence of the formation and evolution of icy dust grains.

                        The carbon monoxide (CO) spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of
galaxies contain a wealth of information about conditions in their cold
interstellar gas. Here we use galaxy-scale observations of the three lowest
energy CO lines to determine SLEDs and line ratios in a sample of 47 nearby,
predominantly star forming galaxies. We find systematic trend of higher gas
excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with the range of variations being even larger than
predicted by simulations. Power law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of
SFR and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ provide a good description of the trends seen in our
sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types
compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for
estimating CO(1-0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3-2) or
CO(2-1) in cases where CO(1-0) is not observed directly. We compare our
observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical
properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas
conditions in star forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with
increasing gas density in more actively star forming systems.

                        Tracing dense molecular gas, the fuel for star formation, is essential for
the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation
processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the
emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of
the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds
with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and
HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk
molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the
center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and
HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across
the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular
gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and
radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these
scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the
inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when
removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud
density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While
ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface
density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby
star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51
that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased
ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few
kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed
mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission
at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.

                        We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127
hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M,
F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W,
F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS
and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam
filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$
depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the
area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$
7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and
covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with
existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST
filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper
presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field
layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary
science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic
sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar
mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved
mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete,
MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging
datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood
completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and
facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.
