                        The Kepler field hosts the best studied sample of field star rotation
periods. However, due to Kepler's large 4" pixels, many of its light curves are
at high risk of contamination from background sources. The new Kepler Bonus
Background light curves are de-blended using a PSF algorithm, providing light
curves of over 400,000 new background sources in addition to over 200,000
re-analyzed Kepler prime targets. These light curves provide the opportunity to
search for new rotation periods. Here we apply a convolutional neural network
trained on synthetic spot-modulated light curves to regress rotation periods
from the Kepler Bonus light curves. We obtained periods for 32,159 total
sources, 19,650 of which had previously been measured and 9,811 of which are
new periods for both Kepler prime and background sources. Our method also
detected 608 pulsation frequencies from asteroseismic oscillations in red
giants. We validate our Kepler prime periods against literature values and
present the full period sample. We find excellent agreement with
previously-known literature periods, validating deep learning as a viable class
of period determination methods. Comparing the periods and light curves of
foreground-background pairs, we find that as many as 63% of periodic background
light curves are still blended with the foreground, highlighting limitations of
the de-blending technique.

                        Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test
and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a
Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori
knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the
traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian
hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst
others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions
inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of
extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In
stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are
<10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at
3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian
expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over
the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator
is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This
new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of
the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.

                        The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the
interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures
(screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR
B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank,
Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being
the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties
of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of
$140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but
substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual
modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this
direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local
Bubble.

                        We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured,
type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a
fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from
monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect
quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have
multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a
well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this
fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations
with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network
self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the
bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces
systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we
update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and
monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}.
Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of
luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have
also made our code publicly available.

                        Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet
its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their
binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The
XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray
(ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical
simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is
essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling
the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu
simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a
neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching
observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population.
Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray
luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a
velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is
driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and
redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We
calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation
and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about
0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich
systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for
groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray
follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing
completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors
dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the
comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups
and hydro simulations.

                        Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures
of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun;
solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been
shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements
in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for
these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather
than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed
effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process
itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material,
with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based
on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects
are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the
Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and
CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries.
It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have
differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with
observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative
character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results
demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the
disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms
relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows
carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily
resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for
example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the
convection zones of the stars.

                        With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using
state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE)
in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a
transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In
this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a
polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive
investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly
imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of
reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects
(disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light
dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of
exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar
disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since
2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of
models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and
provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative
representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving
superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge,
this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset,
rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and
baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data
scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major
interdisciplinary breakthroughs.

                        Cosmic rays (CRs) are an integral part of the non-thermal pressure budget in
the interstellar medium (ISM) and are the leading-order ionization mechanism in
cold molecular clouds. We study the impacts that different microphysical CR
diffusion coefficients and streaming speeds have on the evolution of
isothermal, magnetized, turbulent plasmas, relevant to the cold ISM. We
utilized a two-moment CR magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) model, allowing us to
dynamically evolve both CR energy and flux densities with contributions from
Alfv\'enic streaming and anisotropic diffusion. We identify $\textit{coupled}$
and $\textit{decoupled}$ regimes, and define dimensionless Prandtl numbers
$\rm{Pm_c}$ and $\rm{Pm_s}$, which quantify whether the plasma falls within
these two regimes. In the coupled regime -- characteristic of slow streaming
($\rm{Pm_s} < 1$) and low diffusion ($\rm{Pm_c} < 1$) -- the CR fluid imprints
upon the plasma a mixed equation of state between $P_{\rm{c}} \propto
\rho^{4/3}$ (relativistic fluid) and $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{2/3}$
(streaming), where $P_{\rm{c}}$ is the CR pressure, and $\rho$ is the plasma
density. By modifying the sound speed, the coupling reduces the turbulent Mach
number, and hence the amplitude of the density fluctuations, whilst supporting
secular heating of the CR fluid. In contrast, in the decoupled regime
($\rm{Pm_s} > 1$ or $\rm{Pm_c} > 1$) the CR fluid and the plasma have
negligible interactions. We further show that CR heating is enabled by coherent
structures within the compressible velocity field, with no impact on the
turbulence spectrum of incompressible modes.

                        Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies.
They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales
during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial
for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution.
The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of
heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there
has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host
galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical
simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where
sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback
including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent
of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of
multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the
potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We
summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales,
and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.

                        We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB)
stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution
spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the
RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid
contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54.
Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on
the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species
(from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The
sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we
can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by
core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed
[{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex,
compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower
[Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way
stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and
[Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern
of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the
elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower
contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe],
[Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia
(e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture
elements ([Eu/Fe]).

                        As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported
with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and
properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced
by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar
extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,
corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane
characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.
By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic
longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with
the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic
mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at
approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.
Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of
interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material
below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc
above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the
reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of
the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average
extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to
be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of
interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its
implications for the Galactic structure.

                        Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs <50 Myr and <150 pc) are
important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories.
Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is
thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs
with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the
LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry
and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements
the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical
assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or
populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and
most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and
discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the
classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible
with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age
tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified
populations or substructures.

                        Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation
physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty,
clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the
processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using
high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from
\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation,
magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal
retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal
physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar
mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the
metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of
star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of
cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both
ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations.
These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad
metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy.
Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with
recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal
physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy
formation models.

                        Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p
(the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the
Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a
lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission
lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data),
the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to
(-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5
sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the
recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher
frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for
SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).

                        We present the result of near-infrared spectroscopy using Keck/MOSFIRE for 23
member galaxies in an X-ray cluster XCS2215 ($z=1.46$) to investigate the
environmental dependence of gaseous flows and metallicities. We find that the
metallicities derived from H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines of the cluster
galaxies are enhanced by 0.08-0.15 dex with $\sim$2 $\sigma$ significance
compared to field counterparts for the same stellar mass. It suggests that
inefficient gas accretion in the shock-heated intracluster medium (ICM) in the
cluster core results in the lack of metallicity dilution. We also estimate the
mass-loading factor by comparing the observed galaxies with the chemical
evolution model that takes into account the outflow processes on the
metallicity versus gas mass fraction diagram constructed together with the ALMA
data. We find that the outflows from galaxies in the cluster core region tend
to be weaker than those of galaxies in the general field. It is likely due to
the confinement of gas by the high pressure of the surrounding ICM in the
cluster core, which leads to the recycling of the outflowing gas that comes
back to the system and is used for further star formation, resulting in the
progression of chemical evolution. Compared with higher redshift protocluster
galaxies at $z>2$, which tend to show lower metallicity than the field galaxies
due probably to dilution of metals by pristine gas inflow, we are seeing the
transition of gas accretion mode from efficient cold stream mode to the
inefficient hot mode.

                        Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor)
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding
molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in
projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts
the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the
properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why
these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama
Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of
continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers
CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the
nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical
properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared
the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC.
Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and
HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust
lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun,
and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses
obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of
the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas.
Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers
($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young
stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are
consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the
densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

                        Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium,
undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation.
Kinematically colder HI components, identified via kinematic decomposition of
HI 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm
neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$). We analyse these colder HI
components by decomposing HI 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies -
Sextans A, NGC 6822, WLM, NGC 5068, NGC 7793, NGC 1566, and NGC 5236 - spanning
metallicities (0.1 < $Z/Z_{\odot}$ < 1.0) and physical scales (53-1134 pc).
Using a velocity dispersion threshold of 6 km s$^{-1}$, we classify the
kinematically distinct components into narrow (colder) and broad (warmer).
Cross-correlation analysis between the narrow HI components and H$_{2}$ or star
formation rate (SFR) surface density at different spatial scales reveals that
dwarf galaxies exhibit the strongest correlation at ~500-700 pc. The radially
binned narrow HI fraction, $f_{\rm n} = I_{\rm narrowHI}/I_{\rm totalHI}$, in
dwarf galaxies shows no clear trend with metallicity or SFR, while in spirals,
$f_{\rm n}$ is lower in inner regions with higher metallicity and SFR. We find
that the dataset resolution significantly impacts the results, with higher
physical resolution data yielding a higher median $f_{\rm n}$, $\langle f_{\rm
n} \rangle$, per galaxy. With this considered, dwarf galaxies consistently
exhibit a larger $f_{\rm n}$ than spiral galaxies. These findings highlight the
critical role of cold HI in regulating star formation across different galactic
environments and emphasise the need for high-resolution HI observations to
further unravel the connection between atomic-to-molecular gas conversion and
galaxy evolution.

                        Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at $z > 6$) suffers from degeneracies among the
apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These
degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1)
spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to
break these degeneracies with a sample of $N = 22$ high-redshift star-forming
galaxies at $7 < z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 9$, using some of the deepest existing
imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the
imaging from JWST/MIRI at $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$, which provides coverage of the
rest-frame $I$-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population
properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star
formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices.
Evaluating these quantities both with and without the $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ data
point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more
filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the
rest-frame $I$-band coverage for the vast majority ($\approx 80\%$) of our
sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined
by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest
offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within
extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust
characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for
high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at $z
\approx 8$.

                        The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and
spectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of
astrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly
used stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified
form of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates
for photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All
clusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on
their ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model
spectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally
test four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for
individual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce
significant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce
scatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction.
Extinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in
age, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that
because of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of
individual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be
meaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction
curve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting
results when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of
cluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user
choice of SPS code and extinction curve.

                        We present high-frequency (18-24 GHz) radio continuum observations towards
335 methanol masers, excellent signposts for young, embedded high-mass
protostars. These complete the search for hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions
towards young high-mass star-forming clumps within the fourth quadrant of the
Galactic plane. HCHII regions are the earliest observable signatures of radio
continuum emission from high-mass stars ionizing their surroundings, though
their rarity and short lifetimes make them challenging to study. We have
observed methanol maser sites at 20-arcsec resolution and identified 121
discrete high-frequency radio sources. Of these, 42 compact sources are
embedded in dense clumps and coincide with methanol masers, making them as
excellent HCHII region candidates. These sources were followed up at higher
resolution (0.5-arcsec) for confirmation. We constructed spectral energy
distributions across 5-24 GHz to determine their physical properties, fitting
either a simple HII region model or a power-law as needed. This analysis
identified 20 HCHII regions, 9 intermediate objects, 3 UCHII regions, and 3
radio jet candidates. Combining these results with previous findings, the
SCOTCH survey has identified 33 HCHII regions, 15 intermediate objects, 9 UCHII
regions, and 4 radio jet candidates, tripling the known number of HCHII
regions. Eleven of these sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz. This survey
provides a valuable sample of the youngest HII regions and insights into early
massive star formation.

                        Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$
halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC)
region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$,
which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further
examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the
7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3
parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO
and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the
+50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is
partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our
knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be
located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at
the GC region.

                        We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to
identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry.
AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including
magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the
fraction of mid-IR $3-30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law
(frac$_\text{AGN}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample
of $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both
frac$_\text{AGN}$ and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE
galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS
Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$
outlier fractions of $0.19\%$ (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and $0.63\%$ (redshift), with
a root mean square error ($\sigma_\text{RMSE}$) of $0.027$ for
frac$_\text{AGN}$ and a normalized mean absolute deviation
($\sigma_\text{NMAD}$) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_\text{NMAD}$ = 0.074 and
$17.05\%$ outliers, with most outliers at $z_\text{spec} > 2$. AGNBoost
frac$_\text{AGN}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting
($\sigma_\text{RMSE} = 0.183$, $20.41\%$ outliers), and AGNBoost finds a
similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of
AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands
and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest.
AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys
requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

                        We study the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction,
$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified
by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at $z = 2.2-6.6$, using publicly available
deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at
$0.4 - 5.0\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ to estimate their physical properties robustly,
and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (< 100 Myr) and
old LAEs (> 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation
activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star
formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact
morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The
$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar
mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old
LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher
$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ than young LAEs at a given stellar mass.
This implies that Ly$\alpha$ photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs,
possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows.
The average $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of young LAEs remains nearly
constant at $\sim40$% at $z = 2.2-6.6$, suggesting that the previously observed
evolution of global $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs.
Converting $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ to Lyman continuum escape
fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply
the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at $z\sim6$, causing rapid and
late reionization.

                        We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology,
photometric redshifts and physical parameters for more than 700,000 galaxies in
the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our
\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} 255\,h COSMOS-Web program, which provides
deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one
MIRI (F770W) filter over the central $\sim 0.54 {\, \rm deg}^2$ ($\sim 0.2 {\,
\rm deg}^2$ for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and
space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources
using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a
profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide
morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile
fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts,
physical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated
against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift
accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim9$
reaches $\sigma_{\rm MAD} = 0.012$ at $m_{\rm F444W}<28$ and remains at
$\sigma_{\rm MAD} \lesssim 0.03$ as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy
type. This represents a factor of $\sim 2$ improvement at 26 AB mag compared to
COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80\% complete at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm
M}_{\odot}) \sim 9$ at $z \sim 10$ and at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \sim
7$ at $z \sim 0.2$, representing a gain of 1\,dex compared to COSMOS2020.
COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with
complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and
it is ready for scientific exploitation today.

                        We study a sample of nearby (z~0.2) low-luminosity dwarf (10^7 MSun < M* <
10^8 MSun) galaxies which have extreme (0.1 - 3 MSun/yr) star formation rates
(SFRs) for this mass regime, making them plausible analogues of dwarfs at
z~5.5. We compare the properties of these analogues to control samples of
'normal' dwarfs, which reside on the star formation main sequence (SFMS) at
z~0.2 and are matched in their stellar mass and redshift distributions to the
analogue population. The analogue and normal populations do not show
differences, either in their half-light radii or the projected distances to
nodes, filaments and massive galaxies. This suggests that the comparatively
extreme SFRs in the analogues are not driven by them being anomalously compact
or because they reside in specific environments which might provide a larger
gas supply. However, the fractions of interacting galaxies and those that have
early-type morphology are significantly elevated (by factors of ~5.6 and ~9
respectively) in the analogues compared to the normal population. Extrapolation
of the redshift evolution of the star formation main sequence into our mass
range of interest appears to underestimate the SFRs of observed dwarfs at
z~5.5. Since current SFMS measurements remain dominated by low and intermediate
redshift data (especially at low stellar masses), our study suggests that this
underestimation may be driven by interactions (which are more frequent at
earlier epochs) boosting the SFRs in the high-redshift dwarf population. Our
results are consistent with a picture where higher gas availability, augmented
by interactions, drives much of the stellar mass assembly of dwarf galaxies in
the early Universe.

                        The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH)
masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in
the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is
yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works
have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the
SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties
remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the
state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of
these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from
theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find
the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass
predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational
measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling
relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK
v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed
stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low
redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and
the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with smaller trends
with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy
morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations,
with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their
correlations with morphology.

                        We present the HI distribution, kinematics, mass modeling, and disk stability
of the dwarf irregular galaxies ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23 using
high-resolution, high-sensitivity MHONGOOSE survey data from MeerKAT.
ESO444-G084 shows centrally concentrated HI emission, while [KKS2000]23
exhibits irregular high-density clumps. Total HI fluxes measured down to 10^19
and 10^18 cm^-2 are nearly identical, indicating that the increased HI diameter
at lower column densities results mainly from the larger beam, with no
significant extra emission detected. We derive total HI masses of (1.1 +/- 0.1)
x 10^8 and (6.1 +/- 0.3) x 10^8 solar masses for ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23,
respectively. Using PyFAT and TiRiFiC, we extract 3D rotation curves that
reveal disk-like kinematics in both galaxies. ESO444-G084 shows a warp beyond
~1.8 kpc and a fast-rising curve consistent with a centrally concentrated dark
matter distribution, while [KKS2000]23's more gradual rise suggests a more
extended halo. Mass modeling with an isothermal halo and stellar mass-to-light
ratios of 0.20 for ESO444-G084 and 0.18 for [KKS2000]23 yields consistent
results. We analyze disk stability using spatially resolved Toomre Q and
gas-to-critical surface density ratios, linking these with H-alpha and
FUV-based star formation. ESO444-G084 supports localized star formation despite
global stability, while [KKS2000]23 appears gravitationally unstable yet lacks
H-alpha, suggesting that turbulence, gas depletion, or past feedback suppresses
star formation. No inflows or outflows are detected, indicating internal
processes regulate star formation. This study highlights the interplay between
HI morphology, kinematics, dark matter distribution, and disk stability,
showing how internal processes shape dwarf galaxy evolution.

particularly near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and
F444W), provides a transformative dataset reaching down to approximately 28th
magnitude (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to
estimate key physical parameters of galaxies, redshift, stellar mass, star
formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age, directly from photometric
data out to redshift $z = 3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional
galaxy color information onto two-dimensional maps, revealing how physical
properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions.We
first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN
simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters,
demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations,
we find that the SOM delivers reliable estimates despite the increased
complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (NMAD and RMSE
typically between 0.1 and 0.3) confirm the method's precision, with about 70\%
of predictions falling within one standard deviation (dex) of the reference
values. While redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web presents challenges (median
NMAD = 0.05), the overall success of the SOM highlights its potential as a
powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

                        We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive
($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the
JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved
kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our
measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line
spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source
morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are
orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10
galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 =
180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter.
The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain
their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample
indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early
massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with
other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between
rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more
rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and
likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support
compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our
kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These
dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median
$M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in
the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a
scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs,
gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due
to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

                        James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and
compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z >= 4 known as Little Red Dots
(LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad
Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we
present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of
five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected
from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra
covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that
approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show
red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line
emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to
have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are
dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact
star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs).
Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black
hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them
at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of
super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate
significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes
appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but
consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn
relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line
AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

                        Identifying dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume is crucial for
constraining the luminosity function of satellite galaxies in the nearby
universe. We report the detection capabilities of dwarf galaxies within the
Local Volume using the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Based on the
simulated imaging data of CSST, we develop a detection and classification
pipeline that combines traditional image-based search techniques with advanced
machine learning classification models. The simulated Local Volume dwarf
galaxies can be identified using a pre-processing method for "extended source
detection", followed by classification with a pretrained ViT-Base model. This
pipeline achieves a true positive rate (TPR) exceeding 85% with a false
positive rate (FPR) of only 0.1%. We quantify the detection completeness of
Local Volume dwarf galaxies across a three-dimensional parameter space defined
by absolute magnitude ($M_V$), half-light radius ($R_h$), and heliocentric
distance, based on simulated single-exposure CSST wide-field imaging survey
data. For unresolved or semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, our method achieves a
significantly deeper absolute magnitude detection limit compared to
catalog-based approaches, reaching $M_V = -7$ within 10 \Mpc. By combining this
image-based approach with traditional stellar catalog-based "matched filter"
techniques, our automated framework established in this work can identify dwarf
galaxies within 20 \Mpc for the CSST mission.

                        The advent of gravitational wave astronomy (GW) has revolutionized the
observation of cataclysmic cosmic events, such as black hole mergers and
neutron star collisions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) has been at the forefront of these discoveries. However, the
immense volume and complexity of gravitational wave data present significant
challenges for traditional analysis methods. This paper investigates the
growing synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and GW science,
emphasizing how AI enhances signal detection, noise reduction, and data
interpretation. It begins with an overview of GW fundamentals and the role of
machine learning in increasing detector sensitivity. Notable GW events observed
by LIGO are discussed alongside persistent analytical challenges such as data
quality, generalization, and computational constraints. A comprehensive
performance review of AI techniques, including supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, is presented
based on data spanning 2021 to 2024. Evaluation metrics include accuracy,
precision, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and
computational efficiency. Findings indicate that deep learning and supervised
learning outperform other approaches, particularly in enhancing TPR and
minimizing FPR. While unsupervised and reinforcement learning models offer less
precision, they demonstrate high efficiency and potential for real-time
applications. The study also explores AI integration into next-generation
detectors and waveform reconstruction techniques. Overall, the integration of
AI into GW research significantly improves the reliability and speed of event
detection, unlocking new possibilities for exploring the dynamic universe. This
paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the transformative role of AI in
shaping the future of GW astronomy.

well-understood. In this paper, we investigate the effects of merging
environments on star formation in nearby clusters ($0.04<z<0.06$) from the SAMI
Galaxy Survey - A168, A2399, A3380, and EDCC 0442 - which exhibit different
dynamical activity. Using single-fiber spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster
Redshift Survey (SAMI-CRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we trace star
formation (SF) activity across the cluster sample by identifying the
star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild
enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction $f_{SFG}$ in merging clusters,
although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space
distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the
passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the
relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm
H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence
of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both
the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near
possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due
to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that
are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had
longer to quench.
