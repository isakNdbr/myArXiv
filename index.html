                        The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been
discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of
giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary
interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are
hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$
disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the
Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can
serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs
thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf
candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper,
we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using
Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm
3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star
from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around
[Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5
dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$,
Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common
formation pathway.

                        SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of
the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the
nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a
bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While
previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we
present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the
12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along
with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also
perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern
tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions,
including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density.
Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are
gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of
active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate
of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material
to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this
work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star
formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically
reshapes the extended tails.

                        In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of
stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios
from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars.
These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field
stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our
empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N])
abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by
combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular
clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as
a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within
the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have
established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that
have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any
extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm
yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This
relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17
sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be
consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and
APO-K2.

                        Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components
usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios
were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary
interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings
valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars.
We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the
detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a
dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality
photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we
found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other
systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here
are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are
therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in
the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in
these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature,
rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high
incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong
constraints for star formation models.

                        Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active
star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at
different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to
study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies,
the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$)
among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive
star evolution.
  Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars,
and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate
whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0,
are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the
observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2.
  Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in
Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical
spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using
iacob-broad.
  Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in
fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show
$v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this
threshold.
  Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack
of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three
factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may
imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions;
(ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway
stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation
(reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at
birth.

                        The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of
the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed
with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case
when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes
into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on
the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were
taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the
standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and
the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about
25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model
decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In
addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of
the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is
impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also
compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the
ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of
interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund
2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the
hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.

                        While massive quiescent galaxies are known to be poor in atomic hydrogen
(HI), their true HI content remains poorly constrained due to the limited
sensitivity and morphological biases of existing surveys. We present deep HI
observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent
galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast > 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color
(NUV$-r > 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of
$\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the
predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the
majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$
upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) < -3.46$ derived from stacking the
non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high
fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation
with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST
sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only
includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and
its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three
different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions,
background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in
the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type
morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs,
neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that
additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI
deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.

                        We present a statistical study of spatially resolved chemical enrichment in
18 main-sequence galaxies at $z=4$--6, observed with \jwst/NIRSpec IFU as part
of the ALPINE-CRISTAL-\jwst\ survey. Performing an optimized reduction and
calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage
masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust
emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions
vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements
in [O\,\textsc{iii}]/H$\beta$, [O\,\textsc{ii}]/[O\,\textsc{iii}],
[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6732}$/[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6718}$, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and
$L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm UV}$, consistent with elevated electron density, dust
obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and
ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by
recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient
is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, $\Delta \log({\rm O/H}) = 0.02 \pm 0.01$
dex kpc$^{-1}$, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows,
and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations,
we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR).
Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR
surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ than
seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes
linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous
$\sim$1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient
and a stronger coupling between star formation and metallicity than observed in
evolved systems in the local universe.

                        Protostellar multiplicity is a common outcome of the star formation process.
To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical
parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically
characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the
physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average
distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO)
observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to
derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in
Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and
c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated
for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were
compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to
search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature
derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values
of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and
c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios
have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on
the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of
10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical
parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary
protostellar systems; ii) multiple (>2 components) protostellar systems tend to
have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars;
iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of
separation between components in protostellar systems.

                        There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with
stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation
rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In
this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to
better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO
observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We
compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency
in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas
masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES
sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for
comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to
molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their
suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient
star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we
argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or
merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments.
Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of
lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic
component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end,
consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.

                        Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides
insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of
large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace
overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test
this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous,
gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55
at $z_\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band
imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space
Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts,
$z_\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for
companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\pm2$ and $15\pm3$ companion
galaxies exist with consistent $z_\text{phot}$ ($dz \leq 0.2$) within a
projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These
correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\delta = 0.1 \pm 0.2$ and ${\delta} =1.0
\pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \pm 0.4)\sigma$ and $(2.2 \pm 0.6)
\sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane,
HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the
overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite
its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of
two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts
of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small
sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster
cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm
the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.

                        We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the
Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail
distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at
$l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO
$J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm
0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses
of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively,
and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of
the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The
temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the
typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or
close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds
are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the
strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds
represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic
plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is
the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the
falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible
implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar
medium are discussed.
